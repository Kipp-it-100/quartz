# Overview

AWS Outposts Servers are physical compute and storage racks provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) as part of the AWS Outposts family of services. These servers are designed to extend AWS infrastructure, services, and APIs to customer data centers, co-location spaces, or on-premises facilities, allowing customers to run AWS workloads locally.

Here's an overview of AWS Outposts Servers:

### 1. Purpose:

- AWS Outposts Servers enable customers to run a subset of AWS services and workloads locally on premises, providing a consistent hybrid experience across on-premises and cloud environments.
- These servers are ideal for applications that require low latency, data residency, or local data processing, as well as for use cases where customers need to maintain a presence in on-premises or edge locations.

### 2. Hardware Configuration:

- AWS Outposts Servers are pre-configured with compute, storage, and networking resources optimized for running AWS workloads.
- Each server rack includes compute instances powered by AWS-designed CPUs, memory, and storage, allowing customers to run EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and other AWS services locally.
- The servers also come equipped with networking capabilities for connectivity to other on-premises systems, AWS services in the cloud, and the broader internet.

### 3. Managed Service:

- AWS Outposts Servers are managed by AWS, meaning that AWS handles the deployment, installation, configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of the servers and associated infrastructure.
- AWS automatically provisions, installs, and configures the hardware, software, and networking components of the servers, ensuring that they are always up to date and secure.
- Customers can rely on AWS for ongoing operational support, troubleshooting, and management of the servers, reducing the burden on their IT teams.

### 4. Consistent Hybrid Experience:

- With AWS Outposts Servers, customers can use the same AWS APIs, control plane, management tools, and operational practices both on premises and in the AWS cloud.
- This enables a consistent hybrid experience for deploying, managing, and monitoring applications across on-premises and cloud environments, simplifying operations and reducing complexity.

### 5. Use Cases:

- AWS Outposts Servers support a wide range of use cases, including:
    - Edge computing: Running applications at the edge for low-latency processing and real-time analytics.
    - Data residency: Processing sensitive data locally to comply with regulatory requirements.
    - Hybrid cloud deployments: Extending AWS infrastructure and services to on-premises environments for workload portability and flexibility.
    - Latency-sensitive applications: Hosting applications that require rapid data processing and response times.

### 6. Integration with AWS Services:

- AWS Outposts Servers seamlessly integrate with other AWS services, such as AWS Direct Connect, AWS CloudFormation, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and AWS Management Console.
- This integration enables customers to leverage existing AWS tools, services, and workflows in conjunction with their on-premises workloads, streamlining operations and enhancing productivity.

In summary, AWS Outposts Servers provide customers with a fully managed solution for running AWS workloads locally on premises, enabling a consistent hybrid experience and supporting a wide range of use cases across edge, data residency, and hybrid cloud environments.
