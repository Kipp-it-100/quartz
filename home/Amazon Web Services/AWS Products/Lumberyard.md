# Overview

AWS Lumberyard is a free, cross-platform, 3D game engine developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create high-quality games, connect to the AWS cloud, and integrate with Twitch (a platform popular with gamers for streaming live gameplay). Lumberyard is based on CryEngine, but it has been significantly modified and improved by Amazon to integrate natively with AWS and offer additional features and functionality.

### Key Features of AWS Lumberyard

1. **AWS Integration**: Lumberyard is designed to integrate seamlessly with AWS, allowing developers to build or host their game servers on AWS's scalable infrastructure. This integration facilitates features like dynamic multiplayer experiences with less lag and higher reliability.
    
2. **Twitch Integration**: Lumberyard includes built-in Twitch API support, making it easier for developers to incorporate features like Twitch ChatPlay, which allows viewers to interact with games during streams, and Twitch JoinIn, which lets broadcasters invite viewers into their games directly from Twitch.
    
3. **Graphical Fidelity**: Lumberyard supports advanced graphics rendering capabilities, including physically based shaders, dynamic global illumination, vegetation tools, and a comprehensive particle editor to help create immersive game environments.
    
4. **Visual Scripting**: The engine includes a visual scripting tool called Script Canvas that allows developers to create gameplay mechanics and other interactions without the need to write code, making it more accessible to designers and other team members who might not have programming skills.
    
5. **No Royalties**: Unlike some other game engines, Lumberyard is free to use, and Amazon does not charge any royalties on the games you develop using it. Developers only pay for the AWS services they choose to use.
    
6. **Full Source Code Access**: Developers have access to the full source code of the engine, providing the flexibility to customize and extend the engine as needed for their specific game development needs.
    

### How It Works

- **Download and Setup**: Developers download the Lumberyard engine from the AWS website and install it on their local machines. The setup includes integration options for AWS services and Twitch.
    
- **Develop and Design**: Using Lumberyard’s suite of development tools, developers can create game assets, write scripts, and build game environments. The engine supports both C++ programming and visual scripting via Script Canvas.
    
- **Integrate AWS and Twitch**: For games that require backend services like multiplayer servers, developers can integrate AWS services directly into their games. Similarly, features that leverage Twitch’s platform can be added to enhance interaction with viewers.
    
- **Test and Deploy**: Games can be tested directly within the Lumberyard environment and on connected devices. Once testing is complete, games can be deployed on various platforms, including PC, consoles, and mobile devices.
    

### Benefits

- **Cost-Efficiency**: The absence of upfront or royalty fees makes Lumberyard a cost-effective option for game developers, particularly those who already utilize AWS services.
    
- **Enhanced Player Engagement**: The Twitch integrations provide unique opportunities for player engagement and community building, which are valuable for the success of modern games.
    
- **Scalability**: With AWS backend, games built with Lumberyard can scale efficiently to handle varying numbers of players and global multiplayer game deployments.
    

### Use Cases

- **AAA Games**: Suitable for developing high-quality AAA titles with demanding performance and graphical requirements.
    
- **Indie Games**: Accessible for independent game developers looking to leverage advanced game engine capabilities without the associated costs.
    
- **Interactive Streaming Games**: Ideal for creating games that feature interactive elements with live streaming, benefiting from the built-in Twitch integrations.
    

As of the latest updates, while AWS Lumberyard provides robust game development features integrated with cloud and streaming capabilities, Amazon announced the discontinuation of Lumberyard and has transitioned it to an open-source 3D game engine project under the Linux Foundation named Open 3D Engine (O3DE). This move is part of an effort to foster community-driven development and ensure the engine's sustainability and innovation.
