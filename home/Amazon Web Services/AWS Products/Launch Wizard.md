# Overview

AWS Launch Wizard is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that simplifies the process of deploying enterprise applications on AWS. It offers a guided user interface that helps users easily size, configure, and deploy resources for specific applications without needing deep AWS expertise. This tool is particularly useful for deploying applications like Microsoft SQL Server and SAP environments on AWS.

### Key Features of AWS Launch Wizard

1. **Guided Deployment**: AWS Launch Wizard provides a guided deployment experience. It asks users a series of questions about their application requirements, and based on the responses, it recommends a set of resources optimized for the application.
    
2. **Automated Resource Provisioning**: The service automates the provisioning and configuration of AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and networking settings, ensuring that the deployment adheres to AWS best practices.
    
3. **Cost Estimation**: Before deployment, AWS Launch Wizard provides an estimated cost of running the application on AWS. This helps users understand and manage their potential costs upfront.
    
4. **Customizable Templates**: Users can customize templates according to their specific needs, and AWS Launch Wizard ensures that these customizations still align with AWS best practices.
    
5. **Application-Specific Options**: The wizard includes options tailored for specific applications. For example, when deploying SQL Server, it will propose configurations that consider SQL Server best practices.
    

### How It Works

- **Start the Wizard**: Access AWS Launch Wizard from the AWS Management Console. Select the type of application you want to deploy (e.g., SAP, Microsoft SQL Server).
    
- **Define Application Requirements**: Input your application-specific requirements, such as performance, capacity, and compliance needs. The wizard might ask about the number of users, the expected workload, database size, etc.
    
- **Review Configuration and Cost Estimates**: The wizard will suggest an architecture and provide cost estimates. You can review these suggestions and make adjustments if necessary.
    
- **Deploy**: Once you approve the configuration and cost, AWS Launch Wizard will automate the deployment of your application. This includes setting up the network, security, databases, and compute resources.
    
- **Manage and Monitor**: After deployment, you can manage and monitor your application through the AWS Management Console. The resources deployed by Launch Wizard are fully manageable just like any other AWS resources.
    

### Benefits

- **Simplified Deployment**: Reduces the complexity of deploying enterprise applications on AWS, making it accessible for users without deep technical expertise.
    
- **Cost Efficiency**: Helps manage costs by providing clear cost estimates and allowing for adjustments before resources are provisioned.
    
- **Speed and Agility**: Speeds up the deployment process, enabling businesses to get their applications up and running on AWS more quickly.
    
- **Best Practices**: Ensures that the deployment adheres to AWS best practices for security, reliability, and efficiency.
    

### Use Cases

- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Deployment**: Ideal for deploying complex ERP applications like SAP, which require specific configurations for optimal performance.
    
- **Database Deployment**: Simplifies the deployment of databases, particularly Microsoft SQL Server, ensuring they are optimized for performance and cost on AWS.
    
- **Application Migration**: Useful for organizations looking to migrate their on-premises applications to AWS, as it guides them through the process and automates much of the heavy lifting.
    

AWS Launch Wizard is a powerful tool for organizations looking to leverage AWS for their enterprise applications but want to minimize the complexity and risk associated with configuring and deploying cloud resources.
