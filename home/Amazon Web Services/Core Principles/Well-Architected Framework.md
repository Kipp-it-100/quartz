# Overview 
The AWS Well-Architected Framework describes key concepts, design principles, and architectural best-practices for designing and running workloads in the cloud. 

# The Six Pillars

## Operational Excellence
The operational excellence pillar focuses on running and monitoring systems and continually improving processes and procedures.  

- Key topics
	- automating changes
	- responding to events 
	- defining standards to manage daily operations 

## Security
The security pillar focuses on protecting information and systems.

- Key topics
	- confidentiality of data
	- integrity of data
	- managing user permissions
	- establishing controls to detect security of events

## Reliability
The reliability pillar focuses on workloads performing their intended functions and how to recover quickly from failure to meet demands. 

- Key topics
	- distributed system design
	- recovery planning
	- adapting to changing requirements.

## Performance Efficiency
The performance efficiency pillar focuses on structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing resources. 

- Key topics
	- Optimizing workload requirements
		- Selecting appropriate resource types
		- Selecting appropriate resource suzes
	- Monitoring Performance
	- Maintaining Efficiency as business needs evolve

## Cost Optimization
The cost optimization pillar focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs.

- Key Topics
	- understanding spending over time
	- controlling fun allocation
	- selecting resources of right type and quanitity
	- scaling to meet business needs without overspending

## Sustainability
The sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads.

- Key topics
	- [[Shared Responsibility Model]] for sustainability
	- Understanding impact
	- Maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts
