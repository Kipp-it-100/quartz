## Looking for better ways to use obsidian


  

  

This question is not exactly about obsidian, but I know others in this sub use it to achieve what I'm looking for, so here I go.

I'm looking for ways to improve how I take notes and I'd like to use obsidian for that. I'm already aware about the power of linking notes and had seen lots of people mentioning we should write smallnotes in order make the best use of them.

However, I already read lots of those articles, and lots of zettelkasten stuff, and lots of digital garden stuff. I just can't get to it.

Can anyone share a technique or a personal workflow about taking notes of books, articles, videos, thoughts and anything that could lead to a great optimization of PKM?
