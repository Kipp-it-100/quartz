## Overview

1. **[[Fridtjof Nansen]]** was a Norwegian explorer, scientist, diplomat, and humanitarian. He gained international fame after his 1888 cross-country ski expedition across Greenland. Later, he also embarked on the famous Fram expedition (1893-1896) aimed at reaching the North Pole by allowing his ship, Fram, to be frozen in the Arctic ice and drift closer to the Pole.
    
2. **[[Robert Edwin Peary]]** was an American explorer who claimed to have reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. Peary's claim was widely accepted for most of the 20th century, though it has been subject to doubt and controversy. He conducted several expeditions to the Arctic, using innovative techniques and strategies to survive and travel in extreme polar conditions.
    

Both made significant contributions to Arctic exploration and had a lasting impact on the field.
