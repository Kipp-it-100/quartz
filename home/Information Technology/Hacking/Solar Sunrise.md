Solar Sunrise is the name given to a series of coordinated cyber attacks that occurred in February 1998, targeting military computer systems in the United States. These attacks exploited vulnerabilities in the [[Solaris|Solaris operating system]] , hence the name "Solar Sunrise." The attackers managed to gain unauthorized access to over 500 military, government, and private sector networks, raising significant concerns about national security and the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber threats.

Initially, due to the sophisticated nature of the attacks and the high-profile targets, there was speculation that the attacks were orchestrated by a foreign government, possibly as a form of cyber warfare. This led to a large-scale federal investigation involving the FBI, the Department of Defense, and other agencies, known as "Operation Solar Sunrise."

The investigation eventually revealed that the attacks were not the work of a foreign government but rather the actions of two teenagers from California, working with an Israeli teenager who was known online as "Analyzer." The revelation that relatively inexperienced hackers could penetrate and disrupt significant U.S. military systems underscored the need for stronger cybersecurity measures and prompted a reevaluation of how cyber threats were assessed and addressed.

Solar Sunrise is often cited as a turning point in the understanding of cyber threats, leading to increased efforts to bolster cybersecurity within the U.S. government and among critical infrastructure sectors. It highlighted the importance of vulnerability management, the potential impact of cyber attacks on national security, and the need for international cooperation in addressing cyber threats.
