The Solaris Operating System is a [[UNIX]]-based operating system originally developed by Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. It is known for its scalability, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level computing, including servers and workstations. Solaris was designed to support both SPARC and x86 architectures, allowing it to run on a wide range of hardware from different manufacturers.

One of the key features of Solaris is its use of the [[ZFS|ZFS filesystem]] filesystem, which offers high storage capacities and integrates file system and volume management capabilities. Solaris also incorporates the [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] (LDAP) for directory services and the Network File System (NFS) for networked data sharing. Additionally, it supports a wide array of software applications and programming languages, making it versatile for various computing needs.

Over the years, Solaris has been through several versions, with significant improvements in virtualization, security, and performance. After Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, Solaris continued to evolve, with Oracle Solaris 11 being one of the major releases, offering cloud computing capabilities among other advancements.

Despite facing stiff competition from other Unix-like operating systems, especially free and open-source Linux distributions, Solaris has maintained a presence in many enterprise environments, particularly those that require high levels of data integrity, availability, and scalability.
