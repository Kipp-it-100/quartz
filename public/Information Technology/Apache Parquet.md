> **Apache Parquet** is a free and open-source column-oriented data storage format in the [[Apache Hadoop]] ecosystem. It is similar to RCFile and ORC, the other columnar-storage file formats in Hadoop, and is compatible with most of the data processing frameworks around Hadoop. It provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes with enhanced performance to handle complex data in bulk.
