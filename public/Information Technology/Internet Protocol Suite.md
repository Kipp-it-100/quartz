## Overview
**Internet Protocol Suite**, often referred to as TCP/IP due to its most important protocols, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), is a comprehensive set of communications protocols that are used together to enable networked communications between computers. The suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received at the destination. It includes protocols across different layers, such as link layer (Ethernet, Wi-Fi), internet layer (IP, ICMP), transport layer ([[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]), and application layer ([[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]]).
