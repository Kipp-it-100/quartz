## Overview
> A **metatheory** or meta-theory is a theory on a subject matter that is a theory in itself. Analyses or descriptions of an existing theory would be considered meta-theories. If the subject matter of a theoretical statement consists of one or multiple theories, it would also be called a meta-theory. For mathematics and mathematical logic, a metatheory is a mathematical theory about another mathematical theory. Meta-theoretical investigations are part of the philosophy of science. The topic of metascience is an attempt to use scientific knowledge to improve the practice of science itself.
>
> The study of metatheory became widespread during the 20th century after its application to various topics, including scientific linguistics and its concept of [[Metalanguage]].
