# Overview
> **RabbitMQ** is an open-source message-broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and other protocols.
>
> Written in Erlang, the RabbitMQ server is built on the Open Telecom Platform framework for clustering and failover. Client libraries to interface with the broker are available for all major programming languages. The source code is released under the Mozilla Public License.
>
> Since November 2020, there are commercial offerings available of RabbitMQ, for support and enterprise features: "VMware RabbitMQ OVA", "VMware RabbitMQ" and "VMware RabbitMQ for Kubernetes" (different feature levels)  Open-Source RabbitMQ is also packaged by Bitnami and commercially for VMware's Tanzu Application Service.
