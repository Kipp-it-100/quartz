> **Remote Desktop Protocol** (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft Corporation which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection. The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software.
>
> Several clients exist for most versions of Microsoft Windows (including Windows Mobile but the support has ended), Linux (for example Remmina), [[UNIX]], [[macOS]], [[iOS]], Android, and other operating systems. [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]] servers are built into the server and professional editions of Windows operating systems but not home editions; an RDP server for Unix and OS X also exists (for example xrdp). By default, the server listens on TCP port 3389 and UDP port 3389.
>
> Microsoft currently refers to their official RDP client software as Remote Desktop Connection, formerly "Terminal Services Client".
>
> The protocol is an extension of the ITU-T T.128 application sharing protocol. Microsoft makes some specifications public on their website.
