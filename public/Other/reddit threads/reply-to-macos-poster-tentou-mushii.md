Okay, so i recorded a voice memo giving a pretty cursory, yet rambling explanation and transcribed it to text.  

Then passed that transcription ChatGPT to punch it up and look for errors or mistakes in my explanation.

## Since, the following are both true:
 
 1. While I am really well-experienced, never place too much stock in anyone advices, especiallly given specific use cases such as yours.  Even if I 100% right over on my machine, the only person who can do this right or fuck it up entirely is you.  Thus, I will always recommend verifying and checking my suggestions and getting additional opinions. 
 2. ChatGPT remains a top source for quick queries on a variety of subjects, from top-level, down to the weeds.  But when it gets it wrong, it gets is super wrong.

## Chat-GPT-revised reply: 


### First and foremost

Always remember this rule of thumb for backups: **if you have two, you have one; if you have one, you have none.** Always maintain at least two separate backup methods to ensure redundancy. In your case, I’d recommend one Time Machine backup (for system state and incremental changes) and one full disk image or a direct copy of your music library folder for ease of restoration.  When it comes to getting yourself set up on a new configuration, your own excitement is the worst enemy you could have.  

  

### Regarding Time Machine:

  

Time Machine is great for regular backups but can be tricky for restoring older files or setups, especially if there’s a mismatch between macOS versions. It’s better for user files and incremental changes rather than for replicating an entire system setup, especially when dealing with specific file structures your DJ software relies on. If you’ve been using it, note that it doesn’t retain a perfect file hierarchy of app libraries like Rekordbox or Apple Music; it’s more about keeping files intact.

  

### Backing Up Your Music Library:

  

The default Apple Music/iTunes setting to “organize library” can cause chaos for DJs. It rearranges your files based on metadata, which often results in splitting up your carefully curated folder structure. For example, if tracks by the same artist have different featured collaborators, the software creates separate folders, making manual browsing and software referencing a nightmare.

  
#### To prevent further damage:

1. **Disable Library Management:** Ensure the “Keep Music Media Folder Organized” and “Copy Files to Music Media Folder” options are turned off in Preferences.

2. **Back Up Manually:** Locate your actual music files (likely in the ~/Music or a custom directory) and back them up to an external drive, maintaining the folder structure you’re familiar with. Avoid relying on the .musiclibrary file as it’s specific to Apple Music’s organization.

  

### For Rekordbox:

  

Rekordbox, being Pioneer’s software, often stores metadata and references in its database rather than in the actual file system. It’s crucial to back up its database file along with your music. This file is usually found in the ~/Library/Application Support/Pioneer/ directory. Keep the paths consistent if you’re transferring this to a new system; otherwise, Rekordbox will lose track of your files.

  

### Restoration Tips:

• If Apple Music has already reorganized your library, restoring the original structure is possible but tedious. You’d need to manually consolidate files and repair file paths in both Music and Rekordbox.

• Consider using software like [SuperDuper!](https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) or Carbon Copy Cloner to create a **disk image** of your old Mac. A disk image preserves the file structure and system exactly as it was.


```og transcript below
So first and foremost, whenever you're backing anything up to restore from, you never do just one, ever. If you have two, you have one, if you have one, you have none. So do two different methodologies at a minimum.  The difference in your use case would be that time machine while it is intended to to only back up files relative to the base system, which is a constantly changing because McLS does up until recently did big, like breaking updates every year and if you never tried to restore from an old time machine backup, you will, if you ever have, you will have noticed that it's a fucking huge pain in the ass because newer versions that you're trying to roll back aren't compat. It's I can't let me just say this. It's user settings and not the base system and some things it's it's not going to consider the entire structure of the file system, what is which is what you want to be able to reference if you're trying to get your library back to being referenceable by your DJ software. and not have to do too much fucking around with it.  Now, that takes some tinkering and some knowhow and it's kind of, I mean, it's it's relative to how any one person has shit set up. I can't let's see, what what what software does it say that you use uh Record box. Uh, if you're using the default record box config, then I'm sure there's I know record boxes widely used and I think it's I think it's pioneer tangential.  So there's going to be a lot of people who can answer this more specifically than I. All I know is all I know is that when I when I just said, oh, let me play tracks from my library in Apple Music or at the time, it was iTunes. The default for library management is to let iTunes do it for you, which means that let's say you have, I don't know, 150 tracks by dead mouse, but they're not actually all by dead mouse, because one of them is by Deb mouse and uh featured collaborator and another one is dead mouse and another other feature collaborator. So now all of your stuff that used to be in a way that you either either you just had a sloppy library and had everything index and searchable or, you know, you had it organized the way you wanted it as soon as you let uh iTunes or Apple Music touch it, it's going to organize everything within a file structure that is meant to be referenced by a computer rather than a person.  So if you've already done that, um I'm sorry, it's going to be a huge pain to restore it unless, you know, unless you have versioning enabled. I'm kind of rambling on right now. The the the biggest thing to consider is that you want two kinds of backups always.  And having a disk image, which like I said, it is a one to one bite by bite, identical mirror copy of the old system that you had. You definitely want that at a minimum time machine's great for rolling back when you're still running in the running in the environment. It can be tricky when trying to back up an entire install from it.  Does that make sense?
