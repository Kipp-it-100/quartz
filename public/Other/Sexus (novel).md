_Sexus_ by Henry Miller, part of his semi-autobiographical trilogy _The Rosy Crucifixion_ (_Sexus_, _Plexus_, and _Nexus_). This trilogy, like [[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|_Tropic of Cancer_]], delves deeply into themes of sexuality, artistic struggle, and existential longing.

  

In Martin Scorsese’s 1991 remake of _Cape Fear_, Max Cady (Robert De Niro) uses these works to manipulate and influence Danielle Bowden (Juliette Lewis). His references to sexually charged literature like _Tropic of Cancer_ and _Sexus_ underscore his menacing intellect and predatory behavior. The books aren’t just plot devices but symbols of Cady’s distorted worldview—one that revels in subverting societal norms and using them as tools for psychological control.

  

**About Sexus:**

• **Themes**: _Sexus_ explores Miller’s tumultuous relationships, including his obsession with June (based on his real-life second wife), and his struggles with finding artistic purpose.

• **Literary Significance**: Like _Tropic of Cancer_, it was celebrated for its raw prose and boundary-pushing portrayal of sexuality. However, it also faced censorship and legal challenges.

• **Cultural Impact**: _Sexus_ is often viewed as a continuation of Miller’s mission to expose the human condition in its most visceral form, challenging readers to confront their own hypocrisies around love, sex, and identity.

  

The inclusion of these works in _Cape Fear_ heightens the tension, as Cady’s understanding of literature reflects his dangerous, manipulative nature. It also serves as a reminder of the thin line between intellectualism and immorality when wielded by a deeply flawed individual.
