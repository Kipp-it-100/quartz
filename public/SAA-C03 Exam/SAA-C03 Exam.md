# Overview

## Self-Pointers and Fleeting Thoughts
- each question is set up similarly to how a comedian might set up a joke. There is a **set up** and there is a **punchline.**
	- the set up like a joke is typically long-winded, and comes before the actual punchline.  It provides **only context.**
	- the punchline is the actual question being asked.
		- **fucking pay closer attention to it**

- pricing of multitiered services
	- [[Simple Storage Service|S3]]
	- [[Elastic File System (EFS)|EFS]]
