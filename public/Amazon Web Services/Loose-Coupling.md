**Loose coupling** is an AWS best practice that refers to achtecting/arranging config elements in a way that is fault-tolerant, avoid single points of failure. The opposite of a loosely coupled architecture is a brittle architecture.

- A **loosely-coupled architecture** is one in which the system's individual elements do not directly depend on any one other element to the point of one's failure bringing the system to a halt.

- a **brittle architecture** is just as it sounds: it breaks easily.  Single points of failure define a brittle cloud architecture.
