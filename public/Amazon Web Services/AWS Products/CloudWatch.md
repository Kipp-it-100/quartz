# Overview
Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers. CloudWatch provides data and actionable insights to monitor applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health.

- Collect and track metrics
- Collect and monitor log files
- set alarms
- Monitor resources
	- [[Elastic Cloud Compute|EC2]]
	- [[DynamoDB]] tables
	- [[Relational Database Service]] instances
	- Custom metrics generated by your apps and services
	- any log files your apps generate

## CloudWatch Metrics
- CloudWatch provides metrics for every service in AWS
- **Metric** is any variable to monitor, a few examples include:
	- CPUUtilization
	- Networking
	- Bucket size in s3
	- etc
- Metrics belong to [[namespaces]]
- A **Dimension** is an attribute *of* a metric
	- a few examples include:
		- instance ID
		- environment
		- etc...
	- You can have **up to 30 dimensions per metric**

## CloudWatch Logs
- The perfect place to store your application logs in AWS.  To do so, you must first define:
	- Log Groups: arbitrary name, usually representing an application.  Within these groups are:
		- Log Stream: instances within application/ log files/ containers
- You can definite expiry policies
	- Never expire
	- 1 day to 10 years
- It is possible to send your logs to various destinations
	- [[Simple Storage Service|S3]]
	- [[Kinesis Data Streams]]
	- [[Kinesis Firehose|Kinesis Data Firehose]]
	- [[Lambda]]
	- [[OpenSearch Service|OpenSearch]]
- All logs are encrypted by default
- Can setup KMS-based encryption with your own keys
