# Lightsail
Amazon Lightsail is designed to be the easiest way to launch and manage a virtual private server with AWS. Lightsail plans include everything you need to jumpstart your project – a virtual machine, SSD- based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP address – for a low, predictable price. It is not used to run batch jobs.
It is great for people with little cloud experience to launch quickly a popular IT solution ready to use immediately.
