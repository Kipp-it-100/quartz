7. **Security and Access Control**: MediaConvert enforces security best practices and access controls, supporting encryption at rest and in transit, integration with AWS IAM for fine-grained access permissions, and secure handling of sensitive video content.
8. **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**: MediaConvert enables adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) by creating multiple renditions of video content at different bitrates and resolutions, facilitating smooth playback and adaptive streaming experiences for end-users.
9. **Captioning and Subtitling**: MediaConvert supports the insertion of closed captions and subtitles into video content, allowing organizations to comply with accessibility standards and deliver localized viewing experiences for global audiences.
10. **HDR and Wide Color Gamut**: MediaConvert provides support for high dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut (WCG) encoding, enabling organizations to deliver immersive and visually stunning video content with enhanced color depth and contrast.

### How It Works:

1. **Input Media Files**: Users upload input media files (such as video clips or movies) to Amazon S3 buckets or provide HTTP/HTTPS URLs pointing to the source content stored in external locations.
2. **Transcoding Jobs**: Users create transcoding jobs using the MediaConvert API or console, specifying input files, output formats, presets, and transcoding settings.
3. **Processing and Encoding**: MediaConvert processes the transcoding jobs asynchronously, retrieving input files from S3, applying transcoding settings and presets, and encoding the video content according to the specified output formats.
4. **Output Delivery**: Once transcoding is complete, MediaConvert delivers the transcoded output files to designated S3 buckets or external locations, making them available for download, streaming, or distribution to end-users.
5. **Monitoring and Management**: Users can monitor transcoding job status, progress, and performance using the MediaConvert console or API, accessing detailed metrics, logs, and notifications for troubleshooting and optimization.
