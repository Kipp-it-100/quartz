# Overview

### Service Overview:

AWS Elemental MediaLive is a real-time video processing service that allows broadcasters, content owners, and media companies to encode live video streams for broadcast and multiscreen distribution. It enables the creation of high-quality live video streams with features like adaptive bitrate encoding, real-time graphics overlay, and content protection, making it suitable for a wide range of live video applications.

### Key Features:

1. **Live Video Encoding**: MediaLive offers high-quality video encoding in real-time, converting input video sources into multiple output streams with adaptive bitrate profiles to ensure optimal playback quality across different devices and network conditions.
2. **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR)**: MediaLive supports adaptive bitrate streaming, allowing viewers to receive the best possible video quality based on their available bandwidth and device capabilities, enhancing the viewing experience and reducing buffering.
3. **Real-Time Graphics Overlay**: MediaLive enables the insertion of real-time graphics, logos, captions, and other metadata into live video streams, providing dynamic branding, informational overlays, and interactive elements for enhanced viewer engagement.
4. **Content Protection**: MediaLive offers built-in support for Digital Rights Management (DRM) and encryption, allowing content owners to protect their live video streams from unauthorized access and piracy, ensuring compliance with security and licensing requirements.
5. **Input Redundancy and Failover**: MediaLive provides input redundancy and failover capabilities, allowing users to ingest live video from multiple sources and automatically switch between backup inputs in case of primary source failure or network issues.
6. **Frame-Accurate SCTE-35 Cueing**: MediaLive supports frame-accurate SCTE-35 cueing for ad insertion and content replacement, enabling broadcasters to seamlessly splice in advertisements, promos, and content markers during live broadcasts without disrupting the viewing experience.
7. **Low Latency Encoding**: MediaLive offers low-latency encoding presets and settings for real-time applications such as live sports, news, and interactive events, minimizing the delay between content capture and viewer playback to ensure timely delivery and engagement.
8. **Integration with AWS Services**: MediaLive integrates seamlessly with other AWS services such as AWS Elemental MediaPackage, AWS Elemental MediaStore, and Amazon CloudFront, enabling end-to-end live video workflows and content delivery pipelines.
9. **Scalability and Elasticity**: MediaLive automatically scales to handle fluctuations in live video traffic and audience demand, provisioning resources dynamically to accommodate peak usage periods and scale up or down as needed without manual intervention.
10. **Monitoring and Analytics**: MediaLive provides real-time monitoring and analytics dashboards, allowing users to track key performance metrics such as bitrate, latency, and error rates, and troubleshoot issues for optimal stream quality and reliability.

### How It Works:

1. **Input Configuration**: Users configure MediaLive channels with input settings, specifying the source of the live video stream (such as SDI, HDMI, or RTMP), input redundancy options, and failover behavior.
2. **Encoding Presets**: Users select encoding presets and settings for the MediaLive channels, choosing parameters such as video codec, bitrate, resolution, frame rate, and audio encoding options to optimize stream quality and compatibility.
3. **Graphics Overlay**: Users create real-time graphics overlays using MediaLive's built-in graphics capabilities or external graphics systems, adding branding, logos, captions, and dynamic metadata to the live video stream.
4. **Content Protection**: Users enable content protection features such as encryption and DRM to secure their live video streams, ensuring compliance with security and licensing requirements and preventing unauthorized access and piracy.
5. **Output Formats and Protocols**: Users configure output settings for MediaLive channels, selecting output formats (such as HLS, DASH, or RTMP) and protocols (such as HTTP, HTTPS, or UDP) for multiscreen distribution and playback.
6. **Channel Start and Monitoring**: Users start MediaLive channels to initiate live video encoding, monitoring channel status, performance metrics, and error logs in real-time using the MediaLive console or API for troubleshooting and optimization.
7. **Scaling and Elasticity**: MediaLive automatically scales encoding resources based on incoming video traffic and viewer demand, provisioning additional resources or scaling down capacity as needed to ensure smooth and reliable stream delivery.
8. **Integration with AWS Services**: Users integrate MediaLive channels with other AWS services such as AWS Elemental MediaPackage for content packaging and delivery, AWS Elemental MediaStore for origin storage, and Amazon CloudFront for global content delivery and caching.
