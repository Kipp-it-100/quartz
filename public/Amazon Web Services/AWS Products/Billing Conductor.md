# Overview 

AWS Billing Conductor is a service designed by Amazon Web Services to provide AWS customers with more flexibility and control over their billing and cost management processes. This service is particularly useful for organizations that need to allocate and report costs in a detailed manner, such as allocating costs to different departments or projects, or for providing detailed billing to end customers.

### Key Features of AWS Billing Conductor

1. **Custom Pricing**: AWS Billing Conductor allows you to apply custom pricing and discounts to your AWS usage. This is particularly useful for organizations that resell AWS services to their customers and want to apply their own pricing models.
    
2. **Detailed Cost Allocation**: It enables detailed cost allocation tagging, allowing you to assign costs to specific teams, projects, or customers based on usage. This helps in generating precise billing reports that reflect the actual usage per department or customer.
    
3. **Billing Reports**: Generate customized billing reports that incorporate your specific pricing, discounts, and cost allocations. These reports can be used for internal budgeting or provided to customers to show their usage and associated costs.
    
4. **Multi-Account Support**: Supports detailed billing across multiple AWS accounts, which is ideal for enterprises with complex organizational structures or for AWS resellers managing multiple customer accounts.
    
5. **Integration with AWS Cost Management Tools**: Seamlessly integrates with AWS [[Cost Explorer]], AWS [[Budgets]], and AWS [[Cost and Usage Report]], enhancing these tools with custom pricing and detailed allocation capabilities.
    

### How It Works

- **Setup Custom Pricing Models**: Define custom pricing rules for different AWS services or usage types. You can set specific prices or apply discounts based on the consumption levels.
    
- **Tag Resources for Allocation**: Use tagging to associate AWS resources with specific departments, projects, or customers. AWS Billing Conductor uses these tags to allocate costs accordingly.
    
- **Generate and Distribute Reports**: Create detailed billing reports based on the defined pricing and allocation rules. These reports can then be used internally or shared with external customers to show transparent billing based on actual usage.
    
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly monitor the effectiveness of your pricing strategies and cost allocations. Adjust the rules as necessary to reflect changes in organizational structure, customer agreements, or AWS pricing.
    

### Benefits

- **Increased Transparency**: Provides detailed insights into AWS costs and usage, allowing for better transparency with internal stakeholders and external customers.
    
- **Customizable Pricing**: Enables the application of custom pricing and discount models, allowing businesses that resell AWS services to manage profitability more effectively.
    
- **Enhanced Cost Management**: Helps organizations manage and allocate costs more accurately, which is crucial for budgeting and financial management.
    

### Use Cases

- **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)**: MSPs can use AWS Billing Conductor to create customized billing for their clients, applying their own margins and discounts while providing detailed usage reports.
    
- **Large Enterprises**: For enterprises with multiple departments or projects, it allows financial teams to allocate AWS costs accurately, ensuring that each department or project is charged according to its actual usage.
    
- **Software as a Service (SaaS) Providers**: [[Software-as-a-Service|SaaS]] companies can utilize it to manage the costs of multi-tenant architectures where different customers may have varying pricing agreements.
    

AWS Billing Conductor is a powerful tool for any organization that needs detailed control over AWS billing and cost allocation, providing the capabilities needed to tailor billing to specific business requirements and customer agreements.
