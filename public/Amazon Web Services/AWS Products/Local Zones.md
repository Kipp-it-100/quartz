# Local Zones
AWS Local Zones allow you to use select AWS services, like compute and storage services, closer to more end-users, providing them very low latency access to the applications running locally. AWS Local Zones are also connected to the parent region via Amazonâ€™s redundant and very high bandwidth private network, giving applications running in AWS Local Zones fast, secure, and seamless access to the rest of AWS services.

You should use AWS Local Zones to deploy workloads closer to your end-users for lowlatency requirements. AWS Local Zones have their connection to the internet and support AWS Direct Connect, so resources created in the Local Zone can serve local end-users with very low-latency communications. Various AWS services such as Amazon [[Elastic Cloud Compute|Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)]], [[Virtual Private Cloud|Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)]], Amazon [[Elastic Block Store|Elastic Block Store (EBS)]], [[FSx|Amazon FSx]], [[Elastic Load Balancing|Amazon Elastic Load Balancing]], [[Elastic MapReduce (EMR)|Amazon EMR]], [[ElastiCache|Amazon ElastiCache]], and [[Relational Database Service|Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)]] are available locally in the AWS Local Zones. You can also use services that orchestrate or work with local services such as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, Amazon EKS clusters, Amazon ECS clusters, Amazon EC2 Systems Manager, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS CloudFormation. AWS Local Zones also provide a high-bandwidth, secure connection to the AWS Region, allowing you to seamlessly connect to the full range of services in the AWS Region through the same APIs and toolsets.
