# Overview

AWS Artifact is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that offers on-demand access to AWS security and compliance documents, such as audit artifacts, service compliance reports, and other certifications to demonstrate the security and compliance of the AWS infrastructure. AWS Artifact is designed to help AWS customers to meet regulatory and compliance requirements for their cloud-based operations.

### Key Features of AWS Artifact

1. **On-Demand Access**: AWS Artifact provides immediate online access to a wide range of compliance documentation related to AWS services. This includes AWS ISO certifications, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance reports, and reports from third-party auditors.
    
2. **AWS Artifact Reports**: This part of the service gives customers access to compliance reports from AWS services. Examples include the AWS SOC (Service Organization Control) reports, PCI, and ISO reports. These reports can help customers understand AWS compliance with global standards and regulations.
    
3. **AWS Artifact Agreements**: This feature allows customers to review, accept, and manage legal agreements with AWS for both the account and at the organization level. This includes agreements such as the AWS Business Associate Addendum (BAA), which customers who handle protected health information (PHI) may require under HIPAA regulations.
    
4. **Global and Diverse Compliance Coverage**: AWS Artifact provides documentation relevant to various global compliance frameworks, helping customers ensure they meet local and international regulatory requirements.
    
5. **Secure and Managed Access**: Access to AWS Artifact is controlled through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), allowing administrators to manage who can view and accept agreements or access reports within their organization.
    

### How It Works

- **Access via AWS Management Console**: Users access AWS Artifact directly through the AWS Management Console. There is no setup or subscription required to access the service.
- **Browse and Download Reports**: Users can browse through the available compliance documents and download them for review and record-keeping. These documents can be crucial during audits to demonstrate the compliance of the infrastructure used.
- **Manage Agreements**: Users can also review and accept legal agreements with AWS directly through AWS Artifact. Once accepted, these agreements apply to all accounts under the userâ€™s AWS organization, unless otherwise specified.

### Benefits

- **Enhance Transparency**: AWS Artifact enhances transparency by providing detailed insights into AWS compliance and security, which can increase trust for customers concerned about meeting their own compliance obligations.
- **Ease of Compliance**: By providing easy access to necessary compliance documentation, AWS Artifact helps organizations meet regulatory requirements more efficiently and with less administrative burden.
- **Cost-Effective**: AWS Artifact is offered at no additional charge, making compliance and audit documentation accessible without extra cost.

### Use Cases

- **Regulated Industries**: Highly useful for industries such as healthcare, finance, and government, where proving compliance with specific regulatory standards is mandatory.
- **Audit Preparation**: Helps organizations prepare for internal and external audits by providing easy access to necessary compliance reports and documentation.
- **Legal Agreement Management**: Simplifies the process of managing legal agreements between an organization and AWS, especially useful when deploying services that require specific compliance assurances, like handling PHI under HIPAA.

AWS Artifact is a crucial tool for any AWS customer who needs ready access to AWS compliance and security documentation either for audit purposes, regulatory compliance, or internal company policies. It simplifies the task of obtaining and managing the necessary paperwork to demonstrate compliance across a range of regulatory requirements.
