# Systems Manager
Systems Manager provides a unified user interface so you can view operational data from multiple AWS services and allows you to automate operational tasks across your AWS resources. With Systems Manager, you can group resources, like Amazon EC2 instances, [[Simple Storage Service|Amazon S3]] buckets, or [[Relational Database Service|Amazon RDS]] instances, by application, view operational data for monitoring and troubleshooting, and take action on your groups of resources. You cannot use Systems Manager to share the reserved EC2 instances amongst multiple AWS accounts.

AWS SSM Session Manager is a fully-managed service that provides you with an interactive browser-based shell and CLI experience. It helps provide secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, and manage SSH keys. Session Manager helps to enable compliance with corporate policies that require controlled access to instances, increase security and auditability of access to the instances while providing simplicity and cross-platform instance access to end-users.
