# Overview

AWS Private 5G is not a specific AWS service or offering. However, AWS does provide various services and solutions that can be used to build and deploy private 5G networks or components of 5G infrastructure in a private or enterprise environment. Here's an overview of how AWS can be leveraged to implement private 5G solutions:

### 1. AWS Wavelength:

- **Overview**: AWS Wavelength brings AWS compute and storage services to the edge of 5G networks, allowing developers to build ultra-low latency applications that require proximity to mobile users.
- **Private 5G Use Case**: Enterprises can deploy private 5G networks using AWS Wavelength zones located at the edge of mobile networks. This enables them to run latency-sensitive applications, such as industrial IoT, augmented reality, and real-time analytics, with minimal latency.

### 2. AWS Outposts:

- **Overview**: AWS Outposts brings native AWS services and infrastructure to on-premises data centers or edge locations, allowing customers to run AWS workloads locally.
- **Private 5G Use Case**: Enterprises can deploy private 5G networks using AWS Outposts racks equipped with 5G hardware and software components. This enables them to build and operate their own private 5G infrastructure for use cases such as smart manufacturing, logistics, and campus environments.

### 3. AWS IoT Core:

- **Overview**: AWS IoT Core is a managed cloud service that enables devices to securely connect to the AWS Cloud and interact with other AWS services.
- **Private 5G Use Case**: AWS IoT Core can be used to connect 5G-enabled devices, sensors, and gateways to the AWS Cloud over private or enterprise networks. This enables enterprises to collect, process, and analyze data from 5G-connected assets and devices for various IoT applications.

### 4. AWS Direct Connect:

- **Overview**: AWS Direct Connect provides dedicated network connections between customer data centers, office locations, or colocation facilities and the AWS Cloud.
- **Private 5G Use Case**: Enterprises can use AWS Direct Connect to establish private, high-speed connections between their private 5G networks and AWS services running in the cloud. This ensures reliable and secure connectivity for data exchange and application integration.

### 5. AWS Partner Network (APN) Solutions:

- **Overview**: AWS partners offer a range of solutions and services for building and deploying private 5G networks, including hardware, software, consulting, and integration services.
- **Private 5G Use Case**: Enterprises can leverage APN partners to design, deploy, and manage private 5G networks tailored to their specific requirements. Partners may offer solutions for radio access network (RAN) deployment, core network infrastructure, network management, and security.

### 6. AWS Marketplace:

- **Overview**: AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog of software, services, and solutions that run on AWS infrastructure.
- **Private 5G Use Case**: Enterprises can explore and discover third-party solutions and offerings in AWS Marketplace related to private 5G networking, such as software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), network management, and optimization tools.

By leveraging these AWS services, solutions, and partner offerings, enterprises can build, deploy, and manage private 5G networks to support their specific use cases, requirements, and business objectives. These solutions enable enterprises to harness the power of 5G technology for improved connectivity, efficiency, and innovation within their organizations.
