## Overview
The AWS Application Cost Profiler is a service that helps you understand and manage the costs associated with multi-tenant applications by tracking the consumption of shared AWS resources. This service enables organizations, particularly Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), to get detailed, tenant-specific cost breakdowns. This can help in understanding the gross margin per tenant and improving profitability through better cost allocation and pricing strategies.

You can configure AWS Application Cost Profiler to collect tenant usage metadata and report costs on an hourly basis, either daily or monthly. This allows you to build custom dashboards to monitor cost patterns and margins per tenant, providing a granular insight into how resources are utilized across different tenants within your organization.

It's important to note that AWS Application Cost Profiler will be discontinued after September 30, 2024, and is no longer accepting new customers. This means you should consider other solutions or plan accordingly if you are currently using or were planning to use this service for your cost management needsâ€‹
