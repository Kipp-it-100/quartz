# Overview

The AWS Migration Evaluator (formerly known as TSO Logic) is a tool provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps customers assess their on-premises infrastructure and estimate the cost savings and performance improvements achievable by migrating to the AWS Cloud. It analyzes historical resource utilization data and generates insights and recommendations to guide migration decisions.

### Key Features of AWS Migration Evaluator

1. **Infrastructure Assessment**: The tool collects and analyzes historical performance data from on-premises infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking equipment. It provides detailed insights into resource utilization, including CPU, memory, storage, and network usage.
    
2. **Cost Estimation**: AWS Migration Evaluator estimates the total cost of running on-premises workloads in the AWS Cloud based on usage patterns and pricing models. It considers factors such as compute instance types, storage options, data transfer costs, and licensing fees.
    
3. **Rightsizing Recommendations**: The tool identifies opportunities to optimize resource utilization and reduce costs by right-sizing instances and storage volumes based on historical usage patterns. It recommends the most cost-effective AWS services and instance types for each workload.
    
4. **Performance Improvement Analysis**: AWS Migration Evaluator assesses the performance improvements achievable by migrating to the AWS Cloud, such as faster compute and storage performance, improved scalability, and enhanced availability and reliability.
    
5. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis**: The tool calculates the total cost of ownership for on-premises infrastructure compared to running equivalent workloads in the AWS Cloud over a specified period. It factors in both capital and operational expenses to provide a comprehensive TCO analysis.
    
6. **Scenario Modeling**: Users can simulate different migration scenarios and compare the cost and performance implications of various migration strategies, such as lift-and-shift, re-platforming, or re-architecting applications.
    
7. **Custom Reporting**: AWS Migration Evaluator generates customized reports and dashboards that summarize assessment findings, cost estimates, and migration recommendations. These reports help stakeholders make informed decisions about migration strategies and investments.
    

### How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Users install data collection agents or connectors on their on-premises infrastructure to gather historical performance data, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization.
    
2. **Analysis and Assessment**: AWS Migration Evaluator analyzes the collected data to assess resource utilization, identify optimization opportunities, and estimate the cost of running workloads in the AWS Cloud.
    
3. **Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, the tool generates recommendations for rightsizing instances, selecting storage options, optimizing networking configurations, and choosing the most cost-effective AWS services.
    
4. **Reporting and Visualization**: Users can view assessment findings, cost estimates, and migration recommendations through customized reports, dashboards, and visualizations provided by the tool's user interface.
    
5. **Decision Making**: Armed with insights from the assessment, stakeholders can make informed decisions about migration strategies, prioritize workloads for migration, and develop migration plans aligned with business goals and objectives.
    

### Benefits

- **Cost Optimization**: Helps organizations identify cost-saving opportunities and optimize resource utilization through rightsizing and cloud-native service selection.
    
- **Performance Improvement**: Provides insights into performance improvements achievable by migrating workloads to the AWS Cloud, such as faster compute and storage performance.
    
- **Risk Mitigation**: Helps mitigate risks associated with migration by providing data-driven insights and recommendations to guide decision-making and planning.
    
- **Business Alignment**: Enables alignment of migration strategies with business goals and objectives by providing comprehensive TCO analysis and scenario modeling capabilities.
    

AWS Migration Evaluator is a valuable tool for organizations planning to migrate workloads to the AWS Cloud, providing data-driven insights and recommendations to optimize costs, improve performance, and mitigate risks associated with migration.
