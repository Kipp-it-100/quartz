AWS SSO is an AWS service that enables you to makes it easy to centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications and provide users with single sign-on access to all their assigned accounts and applications from one place.
With AWS SSO, you can easily manage SSO access and user permissions to all of your accounts in AWS Organizations centrally. AWS SSO allows you to create and manage user identities in AWS SSO’s identity store, or easily connect to your existing identity source including Microsoft Active Directory, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and Okta Universal Directory.
You can use AWS SSO to quickly and easily assign and manage your employees’ access to multiple AWS accounts, SAML-enabled cloud applications (such as Salesforce, Office 365, and Box), and custom-built in-house applications, all from a central place.
