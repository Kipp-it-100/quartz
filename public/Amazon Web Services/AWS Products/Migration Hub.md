# Overview

AWS Migration Hub is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables customers to monitor the progress of application migrations to the AWS Cloud. It provides a centralized hub where users can track the status of their migration projects, view resource utilization, and access key metrics and insights to help streamline the migration process.

### Key Features of AWS Migration Hub

1. **Centralized Migration Tracking**: AWS Migration Hub provides a centralized dashboard where users can track the progress of their migration projects across multiple AWS and partner tools. It offers a unified view of migration status, resource utilization, and application dependencies.
    
2. **Integration with Migration Tools**: Migration Hub integrates with a variety of AWS and third-party migration tools, including AWS Server Migration Service (SMS), AWS Database Migration Service (DMS), and partner solutions, allowing users to track migrations conducted through these tools from a single console.
    
3. **Application Discovery and Assessment**: Migration Hub offers application discovery and assessment capabilities to help users identify and analyze their on-premises applications, dependencies, and infrastructure components prior to migration. This helps in planning and prioritizing migration efforts.
    
4. **Migration Status and Progress Tracking**: Users can monitor the status and progress of their migration projects in real time, including the status of individual resources, migration tasks, and application cutover events. They can view detailed migration timelines and track resource dependencies.
    
5. **Resource Utilization and Health Monitoring**: Migration Hub provides insights into resource utilization, performance metrics, and health checks for migrated workloads. Users can monitor resource usage, identify performance bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues during the migration process.
    
6. **Cost Estimation and Optimization**: Users can estimate the cost of migrating their workloads to the AWS Cloud and optimize migration strategies based on cost projections. Migration Hub provides cost estimation tools and recommendations to help users make informed decisions about resource provisioning and optimization.
    
7. **Security and Compliance**: Migration Hub adheres to AWS security best practices and compliance standards to ensure the security and integrity of migration data. It provides encryption, access controls, and audit logging features to protect sensitive information and ensure regulatory compliance.
    

### How It Works

1. **Setup and Configuration**: Users start by setting up AWS Migration Hub through the AWS Management Console. They configure integration with migration tools and specify the migration projects they want to track.
    
2. **Migration Planning and Assessment**: Users perform application discovery and assessment activities to identify on-premises applications, dependencies, and infrastructure components. They analyze application compatibility, performance requirements, and migration readiness to plan migration strategies.
    
3. **Migration Execution**: Users initiate migration tasks using AWS or partner migration tools, such as AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) or AWS Database Migration Service (DMS). These tools execute migration tasks, replicate data, and provision resources in the AWS Cloud.
    
4. **Monitoring and Tracking**: Migration Hub continuously monitors the progress of migration projects, tracking the status of migration tasks, resource utilization, and application dependencies. Users can view real-time dashboards, metrics, and logs to track migration status and performance.
    
5. **Optimization and Troubleshooting**: Users analyze migration data and performance metrics to optimize migration strategies, identify performance bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues. They can adjust resource provisioning, modify migration plans, and optimize application configurations to improve migration efficiency.
    
6. **Completion and Validation**: Once migrations are completed, users perform validation and testing activities to ensure that migrated workloads are functioning as expected in the AWS Cloud. They verify data integrity, application functionality, and performance benchmarks to validate migration success.
    

### Benefits

- **Centralized Visibility**: Provides a centralized dashboard and unified view of migration projects, status, and resource utilization across multiple migration tools and projects.
    
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Enables real-time monitoring and tracking of migration progress, status, and performance metrics to streamline migration execution and troubleshooting.
    
- **Cost Estimation and Optimization**: Helps estimate migration costs, optimize migration strategies, and identify cost-saving opportunities to maximize return on investment (ROI).
    
- **Security and Compliance**: Adheres to AWS security best practices and compliance standards to ensure the security, integrity, and confidentiality of migration data and resources.
    

AWS Migration Hub is a valuable tool for organizations migrating workloads to the AWS Cloud, providing visibility, insights, and control over the migration process to help ensure successful and efficient migrations.
