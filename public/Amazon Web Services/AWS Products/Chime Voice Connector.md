# Overview

AWS Chime Voice Connector is a service that offers a secure, global calling service for businesses that need to seamlessly integrate voice communication into their existing phone systems or applications. It enables users to place and receive phone calls, route calls, and connect their [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) infrastructure to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) using AWS. This service is part of the broader AWS Chime suite, which focuses on real-time communication solutions.

### Key Features of AWS Chime Voice Connector

1. **SIP Trunking**: AWS Chime Voice Connector provides SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking capabilities, allowing businesses to connect their existing on-premises telephony infrastructure or cloud-based services to the PSTN without needing traditional phone lines.
    
2. **Scalability and Elasticity**: Like many AWS services, the Voice Connector is designed to scale automatically based on usage. This elasticity ensures that it can handle varying call volumes without requiring manual intervention.
    
3. **Pay-as-you-go Pricing**: The service uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model, meaning businesses only pay for the calling minutes they use, with no upfront fees or long-term contracts. This can result in significant cost savings compared to traditional telephony services.
    
4. **Global Reach**: AWS Chime Voice Connector provides a global service that allows users to place and receive phone calls internationally, supporting business operations across different countries.
    
5. **Encryption**: Calls made through the AWS Chime Voice Connector are encrypted to ensure secure voice communication, enhancing privacy and compliance with industry standards.
    
6. **Integration with AWS Services**: The service integrates well with other AWS services, providing options for detailed logging with AWS CloudTrail, call detail records storage with Amazon S3, and more.
    

### How It Works

- **Set Up**: Businesses start by setting up the AWS Chime Voice Connector in their AWS account. This involves configuring SIP trunking settings to connect their existing VoIP systems or applications to the service.
    
- **Number Management**: Users can manage their phone numbers directly through AWS Chime Voice Connector, including ordering new phone numbers or porting existing numbers from other services.
    
- **Routing Configuration**: Configure call routing settings to determine how inbound and outbound calls are handled. This setup can include direct routing for Microsoft Teams.
    
- **Integrate and Deploy**: Integrate the Voice Connector with your existing telephony infrastructure or applications, and deploy it. The integration typically involves configuring your PBX or SIP-enabled devices to route calls through the AWS Chime Voice Connector.
