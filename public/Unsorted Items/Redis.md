# Overview

> **Redis** (; Remote Dictionary Server) is a source-available, in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Because it holds all data in memory and because of its design, Redis offers low-latency reads and writes, making it particularly suitable for use cases that require a cache. Redis is the most popular NoSQL database, and one of the most popular databases overall. Redis is used in companies like Twitter, Airbnb, Tinder, Yahoo, Adobe, Hulu, Amazon and OpenAI.
>
> Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indices.
>
> The project was developed and maintained by Salvatore Sanfilippo, starting in 2009. From 2015 until 2020, he led a project core team sponsored by Redis Labs. Salvatore Sanfilippo left Redis as the maintainer in 2020. In 2021 Redis Labs dropped the Labs from its name and now is known simply as "Redis".

> In 2018, some modules for Redis adopted the SSPL. In 2024, the main redis code switched to dual-licensed under the Redis Source Available License v2 and the Server Side Public License v1.
