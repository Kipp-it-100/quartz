Kami Bears! First and foremost, I'm looking back at when you messaged me last and I'm in disbelief that I've let so much time pass without responding. I've just been so busy writing and working and, for some reason, just haven't even been in the mood for music for a while now and didn't want my feedback to be half-assed/phoned in!

But today isn't about me, its about someone who, in stark contrast to myself, is the beesssssssttttt: You!  

You; unstoppable, impossible, jaw-droppable YOU.  She who shines and twinkles brighter and with more sparkle than all the lights and tinsel on all the Christmas trees the whole, wide world over.  'Tis Jesus season, but for my money, mankind's savior just pales in comparison (in both skin tone and character) It's the 34th anniversary of the arrival of a beacon of human excellence to Earth and I really wish I could be there to celebrate the occasion with you.  

I could fill a novel's worth of pages of me singing your praises but all could be summed up by the following:  I miss you and I wish you the most extremely, ridiculously, happiest birthday imaginable.

Happy Birthday, Kami Joy (to the world ðŸ˜‰)
