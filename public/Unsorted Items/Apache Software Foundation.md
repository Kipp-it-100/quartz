> The **Apache Software Foundation** ( É™-PATCH-ee; ASF) is an American nonprofit corporation (classified as a 501(c)(3) organization in the United States) to support a number of open-source software projects. The ASF was formed from a group of developers of the [[Apache Web Server|Apache HTTP Server]], and incorporated on March 25, 1999. As of 2021, it includes approximately 1000 members.

> The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized [[Open so`urce]] community of developers. The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License, a permissive open-source license for free and open-source software (FOSS). The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license, which is to say that it allows developers, who receive the software freely, to redistribute it under non-free terms.  Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a meritocracy, implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects. The ASF is considered a second-generation open-source organization, in that commercial support is provided without the risk of platform lock-in.
>
> Among the ASF's objectives are: to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache projects, and to prevent the "Apache" brand name from being used by other organizations without permission.
>
> The ASF also holds several ApacheCon conferences each year, highlighting Apache projects and related technology.
