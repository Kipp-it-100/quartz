# Overview

> **File Allocation Table** (FAT) is a file system developed for personal computers and was the default filesystem for [[MS-DOS]] and [[Windows]] 9x operating systems. Originally developed in 1977 for use on [[Floppy Disk|floppy disks]], it was adapted for use on hard disks and other devices. The increase in disk drives capacity required three major variants: FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32. FAT was replaced with [[New Technology File System|NTFS]] as the default file system on Microsoft operating systems starting with [[Windows XP]]. Nevertheless, FAT continues to be used on flash and other solid-state memory cards and modules (including USB flash drives), many portable and embedded devices because of its compatibility and ease of implementation.
