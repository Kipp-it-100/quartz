### How to Restart the macOS Core Audio Engine

The macOS Core Audio engine is a crucial component of the operating system that manages audio operations, including audio input and output, MIDI, and various other audio-related processes. Occasionally, users may encounter issues such as audio dropouts, distortion, or the inability to select certain audio devices. Restarting the Core Audio engine can often resolve these problems. This guide will detail the methods to restart the macOS Core Audio engine, ensuring that your audio system runs smoothly.

### Understanding Core Audio

Core Audio is Apple's low-level API for dealing with sound in macOS and iOS. It is responsible for audio playback, recording, MIDI processing, and audio unit hosting. Any issues with Core Audio can disrupt these functionalities, leading to problems with sound quality and device connectivity.

### When to Restart Core Audio

Before diving into the steps, it's essential to identify scenarios that may necessitate a Core Audio restart:

- **Audio Dropouts**: Sudden interruptions in audio playback or recording.
- **Distorted Sound**: Audio that is crackling, popping, or otherwise distorted.
- **Device Recognition Issues**: External audio devices are not recognized or not functioning correctly.
- **MIDI Problems**: Issues with MIDI device connectivity or performance.

### Methods to Restart Core Audio

###$ 1. Restarting Core Audio via Terminal

One of the most effective ways to restart the Core Audio engine is by using the Terminal application. This method involves killing the `coreaudiod` process, which macOS will automatically restart.

##### Steps:

1. **Open Terminal**: You can find Terminal in the Utilities folder within Applications, or by searching for it using Spotlight (Cmd + Space, then type "Terminal").
    
2. **Kill Core Audio Process**: Type the following command and press Enter:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo killall coreaudiod`
    
    You will be prompted to enter your administrator password. Type it and press Enter again. Note that the password will not be visible as you type.
    
3. **Verify Restart**: After running the command, the `coreaudiod` process will terminate and automatically restart. You can verify this by checking your audio output or input settings in the Sound preferences.
    

#### 2. Restarting Core Audio via Activity Monitor

If you prefer a graphical user interface, you can use Activity Monitor to restart Core Audio.

##### Steps:

1. **Open Activity Monitor**: You can find Activity Monitor in the Utilities folder within Applications, or by searching for it using Spotlight.
    
2. **Locate Core Audio Process**: In Activity Monitor, use the search bar at the top right to search for "coreaudiod".
    
3. **Force Quit Core Audio**: Select `coreaudiod` in the list and click the "X" button in the top left corner of the Activity Monitor window. Choose "Force Quit" when prompted.
    
4. **Verify Restart**: The process will automatically restart. Check your audio settings to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
    

#### 3. Restarting the Mac

If the above methods do not resolve your issue, restarting your Mac can also restart the Core Audio engine and may fix the problem.

##### Steps:

1. **Save Work and Close Applications**: Make sure to save any open work and close all applications.
    
2. **Restart Mac**: Click the Apple menu in the top left corner of the screen and select "Restart".
    
3. **Verify Audio**: After your Mac restarts, check your audio settings and test your audio devices.
    

#### 4. Using System Preferences

In some cases, simply changing the audio output device in System Preferences can reset the Core Audio engine.

##### Steps:

1. **Open Sound Preferences**: Click the Apple menu, select "System Preferences", and then click "Sound".
    
2. **Change Output Device**: Switch the audio output to a different device and then back to your preferred device.
    
3. **Verify Audio**: Test the audio to ensure it is working correctly.
    

## Preventing Core Audio Issues

While restarting Core Audio can fix many issues, preventing these problems from occurring in the first place is ideal. Here are some tips:

- **Keep macOS Updated**: Ensure your operating system is up to date with the latest patches and updates from Apple.
- **Update Audio Drivers and Software**: Keep your audio drivers and related software updated.
- **Check for Interference**: Ensure that there is no hardware interference with your audio devices.
- **Regular Maintenance**: Periodically restart your Mac and perform regular maintenance tasks to keep the system running smoothly.

By following these methods, you can effectively restart the macOS Core Audio engine and maintain a stable audio environment on your Mac. Whether through Terminal, Activity Monitor, or a system restart, these steps will help resolve most audio-related issues.

There was a time when loss of all audio functionality was a mild inconvenience.   Like most glitches, it could be resolved by a system reboot. MacOS *does* reboot exceptionally fast, and session restore brings all your windows right back to where you left them before shut down.  
After all, what's two minutes of downtime in the grand scheme of things, right? 

## When and Why to Avoid

A growing remote workforce and the ever-rising popularity of live stream broadcasting illustrate times when an audio failure could strike the hardest.  Maybe the Zoom presentation you're giving to your boss and colleagues suddenly goes silent.  Your microphone has disconnected.  A chorus of coworkers attempts to tell you that you must be muted, but since your speakers have also been disconnected, you hear none of it.

Maybe you run a Twitch channel to supplement your income. One day, you glance at the stream chat window and it's filled with messages from your viewers telling you there's no sound.  This silence is referred to as "dead air" and it is a cardinal sin in broadcasting.  A mere 10 seconds of dead air is long enough for most users to change the channel to something else.  The viewers in chat inform you that you've been silent for  **over 10 minutes.**

## Keep Calm and Do Not Reboot

While restarting your Mac will fix the problem, it would mean disconnecting from your meeting/stream completely.  You would then need to manually rejoin your meeting/re-initialize your stream.  The last thing you want is and further disruption or delay. So instead of restarting the entire machine, we are going to restart only the **Core Audio** service.    

## What is Core Audio?

Core Audio does all the heavy lifting as it concerns sound, both input and output, in macOS. For you digital music producers and DJs out there, it also handles MIDI and AU.  Simply restarting the Core Audio service is highly likely to immediately fix any issues you may be having with any of them.

## Restarting Core Audio

The beauty of this fix lies in its simplicity
1. Open Spotlight by pressing cmd + spacebar
2. Type "Terminal" in the search bar and select Terminal.app.  Its icon looks like this: 
   
   ![[Pasted image 20240614033116.png|150]]
   
3. You will be greeted with a new Terminal window that will look like this:
   
![[CleanShot 2024-06-14 at 03.43.41@2x.png|500]]

4. Copy the following command and paste it into your terminal window.
   
```zsh
sudo killall coreaudiod
```

5. You will be prompted to enter your password. This is your **local password**: the one you use when logging in via the macOS lock screen. 
6. Press ENTER.  If no output is returned, the command has successfully executed with no errors.  Go ahead and exit Terminal.

**You're done!** Pull up your favorite song and it should play through any selected output flawlessly. Alternately, you can test the volume control keys in the topmost row.  If they work, you're back in business!
