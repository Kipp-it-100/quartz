AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. 

You can use AWS Direct Connect to establish a private virtual interface from your on-premise network directly to your Amazon VPC, providing you with a private, high bandwidth network connection between your network and your VPC. This connection is private and does not go over the public internet. It takes at least a month to establish this physical connection.
