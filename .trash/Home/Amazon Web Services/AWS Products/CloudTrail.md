# CloudTrail
AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command-line tools, and other AWS services. You cannot use this service to receive alerts when the reservation utilization falls below the defined threshold.

Auditing and Monitoring: CloudTrail is often used for auditing and monitoring AWS account activity. Look for keywords related to auditing and monitoring, such as "audit," "monitor," "logging," or "tracking."



API Calls: CloudTrail records AWS API calls, so keywords like "API call logs" or "API activity" may suggest CloudTrail as the correct answer.



AWS Resources: It provides visibility into AWS resources, so phrases like "AWS resource tracking" or "resource management" might point to CloudTrail.



S3 Storage: CloudTrail logs are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, so if you see mentions of "S3 storage for logs" or "log file storage," it could indicate CloudTrail.



Security and Compliance: CloudTrail is commonly used to enhance security and ensure compliance. Look for keywords like "security analysis," "compliance auditing," "security logs," or "compliance tracking."



Trail Configuration: AWS CloudTrail allows you to configure trails to specify which AWS services to monitor and where to store logs. Keywords like "trail configuration" or "log file configuration" might be associated with CloudTrail.



AWS Management Console: Actions performed in the AWS Management Console are also recorded by CloudTrail. So, if you see references to "Console activity logs" or "AWS Console actions," it could be a clue.



Multi-Region: CloudTrail supports multi-region logging, so phrases like "multi-region monitoring" or "global activity tracking" could be related to CloudTrail.



Integrations: CloudTrail can be integrated with other AWS services, such as AWS CloudWatch, for real-time monitoring and alerting. Look for keywords related to "integration" with monitoring services.



AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): IAM roles and permissions can be used to control access to CloudTrail, so mentions of "IAM permissions" or "access control" might be relevant.
