# Elastic Block Store
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy to use, highperformance block storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for both throughput and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale. A broad range of workloads, such as relational and non-relational databases, enterprise applications, containerized applications, big data analytics engines, file systems, and media workflows are widely deployed on Amazon EBS. An EBS can only be mounted to one EC2 instance at a time.
