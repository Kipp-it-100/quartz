# Elastic MapReduce (EMR)
the industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using open source tools such as Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto. Amazon EMR can be used to provision resources to run big data workloads on Hadoop clusters. EMR provisions EC2 instances to manage its workload. EMR is not a serverless service.
