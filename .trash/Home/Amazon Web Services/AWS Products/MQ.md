# MQ
Amazon MQ - Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers on AWS. Amazon MQ reduces your operational responsibilities by managing the provisioning, setup, and maintenance of message brokers for you. Because Amazon MQ connects to your current applications with industry-standard APIs and protocols, you can easily migrate to AWS without having to rewrite code.

If you're using messaging with existing applications, and want to move the messaging functionality to the cloud quickly and easily, AWS recommends you consider Amazon MQ.
