OpsWorks lets you use Chef and Puppet to automate how servers are configured, deployed and managed across your Amazon EC2 instances or onpremises compute environments.\nChef and Puppet are automation platforms that allow you to use code to automate the configurations of your servers. OpsWorks lets you use Chef and Puppet to automate how servers are configured, deployed, and managed across your Amazon EC2 instances or on-premises compute environments.\nkeywords: chef or puppet needed\nAWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps you automate the deployment, configuration, and management of applications and infrastructure on AWS cloud resources. It allows you to define the infrastructure and application components of your stack as code, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments across different environments.\nKey Features of AWS OpsWorks\n\n\nStacks: OpsWorks organizes resources and applications into logical groups called “stacks.” Each stack represents a set of AWS resources, including EC2 instances, databases, and load balancers, along with the associated configuration settings and permissions.\n\n\nLayers: Within each stack, OpsWorks uses the concept of “layers” to represent different components of the application stack, such as web servers, application servers, and databases. Each layer can have its own configuration settings and lifecycle events.\n\n\nRecipes: OpsWorks allows you to define custom configuration scripts, called “recipes,” using Chef, an open-source configuration management tool. Recipes can be used to install software packages, configure services, and perform other tasks on instances in the stack.\n\n\nLifecycle Events: OpsWorks provides built-in lifecycle events that trigger at different stages of instance deployment and management, such as setup, configure, deploy, undeploy, and shutdown. You can customize these events by attaching recipes to different lifecycle stages.\n\n\nAuto Healing: OpsWorks monitors the health of instances in your stack and automatically replaces instances that become unhealthy or unresponsive. This helps maintain the availability and reliability of your applications.\n\n\nSecurity: OpsWorks integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to resources and actions within your stack. You can define fine-grained permissions for users and groups, restricting access to sensitive operations and data.\n\n\nIntegration with Other AWS Services: OpsWorks integrates with other AWS services, such as Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, and AWS Elastic Load Balancing, allowing you to provision and manage additional resources as part of your OpsWorks stack.\n\n\nScalability: OpsWorks supports horizontal scaling by allowing you to add or remove instances from your stack based on workload demand. You can configure auto-scaling policies to automatically adjust the number of instances in response to changes in traffic or resource utilization.\n\n\nHow It Works\n\n\nCreate a Stack: You start by creating an OpsWorks stack, which represents a collection of resources and applications. You define the stack’s configuration settings, including the region, VPC, and instance type.\n\n\nDefine Layers: Within the stack, you define layers to represent different components of your application stack, such as web servers, application servers, and databases. Each layer has its own set of configuration settings and lifecycle events.\n\n\nAdd Instances: Next, you add EC2 instances to each layer in the stack. OpsWorks automatically provisions and configures the instances based on the layer’s configuration settings and recipes.\n\n\nConfigure Recipes: You define custom recipes using Chef cookbooks to install software packages, configure services, and perform other tasks on the instances. OpsWorks executes these recipes during the instance’s lifecycle events.\n\n\nDeploy Applications: You deploy your application code to the instances in the stack using built-in deployment tools or custom deployment recipes. OpsWorks handles the deployment process, including code distribution and application startup.\n\n\nMonitor and Manage: OpsWorks provides monitoring and management tools to monitor the health and performance of your instances, view logs and metrics, and perform administrative tasks such as scaling instances and updating configurations.\n\n\nUse Cases for AWS OpsWorks\n\n\nWeb Applications: OpsWorks is well-suited for deploying and managing web applications, including content management systems (CMS), e-commerce platforms, and web services. It provides built-in support for popular web servers and application frameworks.\n\n\nMicroservices Architecture: OpsWorks can be used to deploy and manage microservices-based architectures, where each microservice is deployed as a separate layer within the stack. This allows you to independently scale and manage individual components of your application stack.\n\n\nDevOps Automation: OpsWorks enables DevOps automation by providing tools for automating the deployment, configuration, and management of infrastructure and applications. You can use OpsWorks to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.\n\n\nBig Data and Analytics: OpsWorks can be used to deploy and manage infrastructure for big data and analytics workloads, such as Hadoop clusters, Spark clusters, and data processing pipelines. You can use OpsWorks to automate the provisioning and configuration of cluster nodes.\n\n\nMulti-Tier Applications: OpsWorks supports multi-tier application architectures, where different components of the application stack (e.g., web servers, application servers, databases) are deployed as separate layers within the same stack. This allows you to scale and manage each tier independently.\n\n\nAWS OpsWorks simplifies the process of deploying and managing applications and infrastructure on AWS, allowing you to focus on building and improving your applications rather than managing the underlying infrastructure. With its support for automation, scalability, and integration with other AWS services, OpsWorks is a powerful tool for DevOps teams and developers looking to streamline their deployment processes and improve the reliability of their applications."},"Amazon-Web-Services/AWS-Products/Organizations":{"title":"Organizations","links":["Amazon-Web-Services/Global-AWS-Services"],"tags":[],"content":"Organizations\nGlobal in scale\nhelps you to centrally manage billing; control access, compliance, and security; and share resources across your AWS accounts.

(EDNS0 adds several optional extensions to the DNS protocol.) Route 53 can use edns-client-subnet only when DNS resolvers support it:\nWhen a browser or other viewer uses a DNS resolver that does not support edns-client-subnet, Route 53 uses the source IP address of the DNS resolver to approximate the location of the user and responds to geolocation queries with the DNS record for the resolver’s location.\nWhen a browser or other viewer uses a DNS resolver that does support edns-client-subnet, the DNS resolver sends Route 53 a truncated version of the user’s IP address. Route 53 determines the location of the user based on the truncated IP address rather than the source IP address of the DNS resolver; this typically provides a more accurate estimate of the user’s location.

It’s a part of theIP protocol used in networking. In the context of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), ACK is a flag that is part of the header of TCP segments, used to acknowledge the successful receipt of packets.\nWhen two devices communicate over TCP, they send each other data packets. To ensure reliable delivery, every packet that is received is acknowledged by the recipient. This acknowledgment is done using a TCP segment with the ACK flag set, which tells the sender that their packet was received successfully.\nFor example, if device A sends a packet to device B, device B will respond with an ACK packet if the packet arrives successfully. This lets device A know that it can continue sending more data. If device A doesn’t receive an ACK, it assumes the packet was lost and sends it again.\nACK is a critical mechanism in TCP’s flow control and error handling, helping to ensure that data is transmitted accurately across networks."},"Information-Technology/Active-Directory":{"title":"Active Directory","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nActive Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks.

It authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain-type network, assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. For example, when a user logs into a computer which is part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted username and password and determines whether the user is a system administrator or a non-admin user. Furthermore, it allows the management and storage of information, provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, and establishes a framework to deploy other related services: Certificate Services, Active Directory Federation Services, Lightweight Directory Services, and Rights Management Services.\nActive Directory uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) versions 2 and 3, Microsoft’s version of Kerberos, and DNS.\nRobert R. King defined it in the following way:\n“A domain represents a database. That database holds records about network services-things like computers, users, groups and other things that use, support, or exist on a network.

In simpler terms, it translates IP addresses into Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, which are unique identifiers assigned to network interfaces for communications at the physical layer of a network.\nWhen a device on a local network wants to communicate with another device, it needs to know the MAC address associated with the destination IP address. If the MAC address is unknown, the device broadcasts an ARP request packet to all devices on the local network segment. The device with the matching IP address sends an ARP reply, which includes its MAC address, back to the requester. This information is then stored in the ARP cache of the requesting device for future reference, reducing the need to repeat the ARP request broadcast for subsequent communications.\nARP is a type of protocol used in the network link layer and operates below the network layer, helping to facilitate the flow of information on a local network."},"Information-Technology/Algorithm":{"title":"Algorithm","links":["Information-Technology/Automated-decision-making","Information-Technology/Automated-Reasoning"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nIn mathematics and computer science, an Algorithm ( ) is a finite sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.

Using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by Alan Turing with terms such as “memory”, “search” and “stimulus”.\nIn contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result.  For example, social media recommender systems rely on heuristics in such a way that, although widely characterized as “algorithms” in 21st century popular media, cannot deliver correct results due to the nature of the problem.\nAs an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing “output” and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Apache-ActiveMQ":{"title":"Apache ActiveMQ","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nApache ActiveMQ is an open source message broker written in Java together with a full Java Message Service (JMS) client.

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software which enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\nAI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: “A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it’s not labeled AI anymore.”\nAlan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. The field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques, and after 2017 with the transformer architecture. This led to the AI boom of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.\nThe growing use of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is influencing a societal and economic shift towards increased automation, data-driven decision-making, and the integration of AI systems into various economic sectors and areas of life, impacting job markets, healthcare, government, industry, and education. This raises questions about the long-term effects, ethical implications, and risks of AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\nThe various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field’s long-term goals.\nTo reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Automated-Reasoning":{"title":"Automated Reasoning","links":["Information-Technology/Metalogic"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nIn computer science, in particular in knowledge representation and reasoning and Metalogic, the area of automated reasoning is dedicated to understanding different aspects of reasoning. The study of automated reasoning helps produce computer programs that allow computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically. Although automated reasoning is considered a sub-field of artificial intelligence, it also has connections with theoretical computer science and philosophy.\nThe most developed subareas of automated reasoning are automated theorem proving (and the less automated but more pragmatic subfield of interactive theorem proving) and automated proof checking (viewed as guaranteed correct reasoning under fixed assumptions). Extensive work has also been done in reasoning by analogy using induction and abduction.Other important topics include reasoning under uncertainty and non-monotonic reasoning. An important part of the uncertainty field is that of argumentation, where further constraints of minimality and consistency are applied on top of the more standard automated deduction. John Pollock’s OSCAR system is an example of an automated argumentation system that is more specific than being just an automated theorem prover.\nTools and techniques of automated reasoning include the classical logics and calculi, fuzzy logic, Bayesian inference, reasoning with maximal entropy and many less formal ad hoc techniques.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Automated-decision-making":{"title":"Automated decision-making","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nAutomated decision-making (ADM) involves the use of data, machines and algorithms to make decisions in a range of contexts, including public administration, business, health, education, law, employment, transport, media and entertainment, with varying degrees of human oversight or intervention.

The BIOS interface is where one changes settings related to the motherboard and the low-level interaction between various hardware elements.\n\nIn computing, BIOS (, BY-oss, -⁠ohss; Basic Input/Output System, also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS, BIOS ROM or PC BIOS) is firmware used to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs and to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup). The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on an IBM PC or IBM PC compatible’s system board and exists in some UEFI-based systems to maintain compatibility with operating systems that do not support UEFI native operation. The name originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. The BIOS originally proprietary to the IBM PC has been reverse engineered by some companies (such as Phoenix Technologies) looking to create compatible systems. The interface of that original system serves as a de facto standard.\nThe BIOS in older PCs initializes and tests the system hardware components (power-on self-test), and loads a boot loader from a mass storage device which then initializes a kernel. In the era of DOS, the BIOS provided BIOS interrupt calls for the keyboard, display, storage, and other input/output (I/O) devices that standardized an interface to application programs and the operating system. More recent operating systems do not use the BIOS interrupt calls after startup.\nMost BIOS implementations are specifically designed to work with a particular computer or motherboard model, by interfacing with various devices especially system chipset. Originally, BIOS firmware was stored in a ROM chip on the PC motherboard. In later computer systems, the BIOS contents are stored on flash memory so it can be rewritten without removing the chip from the motherboard. This allows easy, end-user updates to the BIOS firmware so new features can be added or bugs can be fixed, but it also creates a possibility for the computer to become infected with BIOS rootkits. Furthermore, a BIOS upgrade that fails could brick the motherboard. The last version of Microsoft Windows to officially support running on PCs which use legacy BIOS firmware is Windows 10 as Windows 11 requires a UEFI-compliant system.\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a successor to the legacy PC BIOS, aiming to address its technical limitations.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Bathymetric-chart":{"title":"Bathymetric chart","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nA Bathymetric chart is a type of isarithmic map that depicts the submerged bathymetry and physiographic features of ocean and sea bottoms.

Bathymeric charts showcase depth using a series of lines and points at equal intervals, called depth contours or isobaths (a type of contour line). A closed shape with increasingly smaller shapes inside of it can indicate an ocean trench or a seamount, or underwater mountain, depending on whether the depths increase or decrease going inward.\nBathymetric surveys and charts are associated with the science of oceanography, particularly marine geology, and underwater engineering or other specialized purposes.

Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.\nBlockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.\nA blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need for a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.\nPrivate blockchains have been proposed for business use.

C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.\nA successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book The C programming language, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language. C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\nC is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.\nSince 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top two languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Cache-(computing)":{"title":"Cache (computing)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nIn computing, a cache (  KASH) is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.

Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store; thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs.\nTo be cost-effective, caches must be relatively small. Nevertheless, caches are effective in many areas of computing because typical computer applications access data with a high degree of locality of reference.

Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.\nThe fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated. The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Computer":{"title":"Computer","links":["Unsorted-Items/Central-Processing-Unit","Unsorted-Items/microprocessor","Unsorted-Items/Computer-memory"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA Computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation). Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.\nA broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems, including simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, and factory devices like industrial robots. Computers are at the core of general-purpose devices such as personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of computers and users.\nEarly computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II, both electromechanical and using thermionic valves. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (Moore’s law noted that counts doubled every two years), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.\nConventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a Central Processing Unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, together with some type of Computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Computing":{"title":"Computing","links":["Information-Technology/Algorithm"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nComputing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computing machinery.

The goal is to provide High Availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users. CDNs came into existence in the late 1990s as a means for alleviating the performance bottlenecks of the Internet as the Internet was starting to become a mission-critical medium for people and enterprises. Since then, CDNs have grown to serve a large portion of the Internet content today, including web objects (text, graphics and scripts), downloadable objects (media files, software, documents), applications (e-commerce, portals), live streaming media, on-demand streaming media, and social media sites.CDNs are a layer in the internet ecosystem. Content owners such as media companies and e-commerce vendors pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users. In turn, a CDN pays Internet service providers (ISPs), carriers, and network operators for hosting its servers in their data centers.\nCDN is an umbrella term spanning different types of content delivery services: video streaming, software downloads, web and mobile content acceleration, licensed/managed CDN, transparent caching, and services to measure CDN performance, load balancing, Multi CDN switching and analytics and cloud intelligence. CDN vendors may cross over into other industries like security, DDoS protection and web application firewalls (WAF), and WAN optimization.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Cryptography":{"title":"Cryptography","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nCryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptós “hidden, secret”; and γράφειν graphein, “to write”, or -λογία -logia, “study”, respectively), is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, information security, electrical engineering, digital signal processing, physics, and others. Core concepts related to  information security (data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation) are also central to cryptography. Practical applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.\nCryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, converting readable information (plaintext) to unintelligible nonsense text (ciphertext), which can only be read by reversing the process (decryption). The sender of an encrypted (coded) message shares the decryption (decoding) technique only with the intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature often uses the names “Alice” (or “A”) for the sender, “Bob” (or “B”) for the intended recipient, and “Eve” (or “E”) for the eavesdropping adversary. Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II, cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and their applications more varied.\nModern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so. Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore termed “computationally secure”. Theoretical advances (e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms) and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated and, if necessary, adapted. Information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power, such as the one-time pad, are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes.\nThe growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the Information Age. Cryptography’s potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export. In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation. Cryptography also plays a major role in digital rights management and copyright infringement disputes with regard to digital media.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/DOS":{"title":"DOS","links":["Unsorted-Items/MS-DOS"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nDOS (, ) is a family of disk-based operating systems for IBM PC compatible computers.

It enables a data holder to share aggregate patterns of the group while limiting information that is leaked about specific individuals. This is done by injecting carefully calibrated noise into statistical computations such that the utility of the statistic is preserved while provably limiting what can be inferred about any individual in the dataset.\nAnother way to describe differential privacy is as a constraint on the algorithms used to publish aggregate information about a statistical database which limits the disclosure of private information of records in the database. For example, differentially private algorithms are used by some government agencies to publish demographic information or other statistical aggregates while ensuring confidentiality of survey responses, and by companies to collect information about user behavior while controlling what is visible even to internal analysts.\nRoughly, an algorithm is differentially private if an observer seeing its output cannot tell whether a particular individual’s information was used in the computation. Differential privacy is often discussed in the context of identifying individuals whose information may be in a database. Although it does not directly refer to identification and reidentification attacks, differentially private algorithms provably resist such attacks.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Digital-Millenium-Copyright-Act":{"title":"Digital Millenium Copyright Act","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a 1998 United States copyright law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). It criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself.  In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet. Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the United States Senate and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended Title 17 of the United States Code to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of the providers of online services for copyright infringement by their users.\nThe DMCA’s principal innovation in the field of copyright is the exemption from direct and indirect liability of Internet service providers and other intermediaries. This exemption was adopted by the European Union in the Electronic Commerce Directive 2000.

It is designed to handle tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms. Essentially, DirectX provides a middle layer between the hardware (graphics hardware, sound card, etc.) and the software (mainly games or video software) that needs to interact with that hardware.\nKey Components of DirectX\n1. Direct3D: Handles all the 3D graphics calculations and rendering, and is the most widely used component of DirectX for game development.\n2. DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI): Manages low-level tasks like multi-threading and resource management in GPUs.\n3. Direct2D and DirectWrite: Provide tools for 2D graphics and text rendering, often used for developing user interfaces within applications.\n4. DirectCompute: Provides APIs for handling tasks that can be parallelized and executed on the GPU. This is useful for not only graphics but any task that can benefit from the massive parallel processing power of modern GPUs.\n5. DirectSound: Used for low-level sound manipulation and playback. It provides tools to play and record sound samples.\n6. DirectInput: Manages input from various devices like keyboard, mouse, joystick, and other game controllers.\nEvolution of DirectX\nDirectX was first introduced in the mid-1990s to provide developers with a standardized way to access hardware capabilities without having to write hardware-specific code. Before DirectX, software developers had to write optimized hardware code for each type of PC configuration, which was time-consuming and limited the consumer base. With DirectX, Microsoft aimed to simplify the development of multimedia applications on its Windows platform.\nImportance in Gaming\nDirectX is crucial for PC gaming. The introduction of each new version has typically brought advanced features and performance improvements. For example, DirectX 11 introduced tessellation technology, which allows more detailed graphics, and DirectX 12, the latest major version, brought improvements like lower-level rendering API capabilities and better efficiency, which means games can run faster and look better with the same hardware.\nDirectX and Windows\nDirectX is primarily a Windows API and is a key part of Microsoft’s larger vision for gaming across its ecosystem, which includes Windows PCs and Xbox consoles. The Xbox API set has been closely aligned with DirectX, ensuring that developers can more easily develop cross-platform titles across PC and console.\nIn summary, DirectX continues to be a pivotal technology in the realm of video gaming and multimedia on Windows platforms, enabling the creation of visually stunning and high-performance games and applications."},"Information-Technology/Distributed-Denial-of-Service-Attack":{"title":"Distributed Denial of Service Attack","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nIn computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network.

The range of attacks varies widely, spanning from inundating a server with millions of requests to slow its performance, overwhelming a server with a substantial amount of invalid data, to submitting requests with an illegitimate IP address.\nIn a distributed denial-of-service attack (ddos attack), the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. More sophisticated strategies are required to mitigate this type of attack; simply attempting to block a single source is insufficient as there are multiple sources.\nA DoS or DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter, thus disrupting trade and losing the business money.\nCriminal perpetrators of DoS attacks often target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks or credit card payment gateways.

This process converts the original representation of the information, known as, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.\nFor technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an Algorithm. It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.\nHistorically, various forms of encryption have been used to aid in cryptography. Early encryption techniques were often used in military messaging. Since then, new techniques have emerged and become commonplace in all areas of modern computing. Modern encryption schemes use the concepts of public-key and symmetric-key. Modern encryption techniques ensure security because modern computers are inefficient at cracking the encryption.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Extensible-Markup-Language":{"title":"Extensible Markup Language","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nExtensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data.

Key components include:\n\n\nGNU Compiler Collection (GCC): A set of compilers for various programming languages including C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, and Go. GCC is central to the development of GNU and Linux systems.\n\n\nGNU Bash: A Unix shell and command language, which is a default shell on many systems running Linux and macOS.\n\n\nGNU Core Utilities: A package of GNU versions of common management tools for handling files, text streams, and other tasks. These utilities are the basic file, shell, and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system.\n\n\nGNU Debugger (GDB): A portable debugger that runs on many Unix-like systems and works for many programming languages, including Ada, C, C++, Objective-C, Free Pascal, Fortran, Java, and more.\n\n\nGNU Emacs: An extensible, customizable text editor—at its core—and more because it provides an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing.\n\n\nGNU Binutils: A collection of binary tools, including a linker, an assembler, and other tools for managing object files.\n\n\nGNU Operating System\nThe GNU operating system is intended to be a complete free software solution. It includes everything from basic programs and libraries that define the operating system to software applications that run on them. The development of the GNU operating system began in 1984, and it includes many of the official GNU software packages.\nRelationship with Linux\nWhile GNU aimed to develop a complete operating system, by the early 90s, many of its components were complete except for the kernel. In 1991, Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as a freely modifiable source code. The Linux kernel filled the gap in the GNU project, creating a fully functioning free operating system when combined with GNU components. This combination is often referred to as GNU/Linux, though it is commonly called Linux.\nPhilosophy and Licensing\nThe philosophy behind GNU emphasizes the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve software. This is embodied in the GNU General Public License (GPL), which is a widely used free software license that ensures end users the freedom to use, study, share (copy), and modify the software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed “free software.”\nThe GPL aims to guarantee these freedoms by preventing the proprietary use of free software, ensuring that all modifications and extended versions of the program are also free. This has profound implications for the software industry, promoting collaborative software development and protecting the rights of users."},"Information-Technology/Generative-AI":{"title":"Generative AI","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nGenerative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI, or GAI) is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models, often in response to prompts.

It aimed to alter the transfer of healthcare information, stipulated the guidelines by which personally identifiable information maintained by the healthcare and healthcare insurance industries should be protected from fraud and theft, and addressed some limitations on healthcare insurance coverage. It generally prohibits healthcare providers and businesses called covered entities from disclosing protected information to anyone other than a patient and the patient’s authorized representatives without their consent.

Unlike the decimal system representing numbers using ten symbols, hexadecimal uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols “0”–“9” to represent values 0 to 9, and “A”–“F” (or alternatively “a”–“f”) to represent values from ten to fifteen.\nSoftware developers and system designers widely use hexadecimal numbers because they provide a human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits), also known as a nibble (or nybble). For example, an 8-bit byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 (0 to 255 decimal) in binary form, which can be conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.\nIn mathematics, a subscript is typically used to specify the base. For example, the decimal value 23,808 would be expressed in hexadecimal as 5D0016. In programming, several notations denote hexadecimal numbers, usually involving a prefix. The prefix 0x is used in C, which would denote this value as 0x5D00.\nHexadecimal is used in the transfer encoding Base 16, in which each byte of the plain text is broken into two 4-bit values and represented by two hexadecimal digits.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Hypertext-Markup-Language":{"title":"Hypertext Markup Language","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nHypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.\nHTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as  and  directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as  and  surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.\nHTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.\nDevelopment of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and summarized in a simple document describing the behavior of a client and a server using the first HTTP version, named 0.9. That version was subsequently developed, eventually becoming the public 1.0.\nDevelopment of early HTTP Requests for Comments (RFCs) started a few years later in a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.\nHTTP/1 was finalized and fully documented (as version 1.0) in 1996.  It evolved (as version 1.1) in 1997 and then its specifications were updated in 1999, 2014, and 2022.\nIts secure variant named HTTPS is used by more than 85% of websites.\nHTTP/2, published in 2015, provides a more efficient expression of HTTP’s semantics “on the wire”. As of January 2024, it is used by 36% of websites and supported by almost all web browsers (over 98% of users). It is also supported by major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.\nHTTP/3, the successor to HTTP/2, was published in 2022. As of February 2024, it is now used on 29% of websites and is supported by most web browsers, i.e. (at least partially) supported by 97% of users. HTTP/3 uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolesce previous major versions of the protocol. Support for HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome first, and is also enabled in Firefox. HTTP/3 has lower latency for real-world web pages, if enabled on the server, and loads faster than with HTTP/2, in some cases over three times faster than HTTP/1.1 (which is still commonly only enabled).\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Hypervisor":{"title":"Hypervisor","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA Hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM) or virtualizer, is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine. The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. Unlike an emulator, the guest executes most instructions on the native hardware. Multiple instances of a variety of operating systems may share the virtualized hardware resources: for example, Linux, Windows, and macOS instances can all run on a single physical x86 machine. This contrasts with operating-system–level virtualization, where all instances (usually called containers) must share a single kernel, though the guest operating systems can differ in user space, such as different Linux distributions with the same kernel.\nThe term hypervisor is a variant of supervisor, a traditional term for the kernel of an operating system: the hypervisor is the supervisor of the supervisors, with hyper- used as a stronger variant of super-. The term dates to circa 1970; IBM coined it for the 360/65 and later used it for the DIAG handler of CP-67.

Here’s How to Tell if It’s Your ISP’s Fault\nBy Kipp Burroughs\nUpdated Sep 29, 2022\nDo your own investigation to find out if it’s really your fault.\n\nQuick Links\n\n\nIf It’s Not You, It’s Them\n\n\nRuling Out User-Side Problems\n\n\nDiagnose Your Cable Signal Quality\n\n\nWhat Now?\n\n\nPrepare Your List of Findings and Demand a Line Inspection\n\n\nNo one likes internet downtime. It can make you feel completely crippled in your ability to work or communicate, control your home, or monitor your security system. But in those situations, how do you tell who’s to blame?\nIf It’s Not You, It’s Them\nAs remote work and smart home setups become more prevalent, our tolerance for connection failure is shrinking fast. Connection loss is a common intermittent occurrence, but what do you do when the problem becomes incessant and unmanageable? If your issues become persistent, it is possible that the root of the problem has nothing to do with your equipment or settings, but rather is due to a problem on the side of your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and may require a special line technician to intervene.\nThat may be easier said than done.\nHome technician appointments almost never occur on the day you call in a complaint. In fact, chances are that appointments are booked as far as a month out, and getting a line technician to make an appearance is particularly tricky. Line technicians are different than the home technicians that typically answer house calls. Line techs address problems stemming from the main connection to the cable line outside your home.\n\nIn cities, these main connections, or “drops” usually terminate near high voltage power lines and transformers, not to mention the seemingly endless intersecting tangles of cables, lines, and wires. The height, danger, and complexity of line servicing mean that line techs require special licensure and are very costly. Your ISP won’t be too keen on sending out the big guns for any old internet problem.\nRelated: How to Make Your Phone Useful When There’s No Internet\nRuling Out User-Side Problems\nBefore you start down the path of pursuing a line repair, it is important you take a calculated approach to ensure that the problem is, in fact, a problem that needs addressing by your provider and not something on your end. ISP customer support agents and home technicians will try and say most anything to avoid taking on the blame if you aren’t prepared with an exhaustive list of user-side troubleshooting steps you have already checked. We will start from square one.\nYou may have tried several, or all these already, but the checklist below will make sure you’ve examined your issues from all angles before tackling the task of getting a line tech to come out. Document your findings as you progress through this list.\nCheck Connectivity on Another Device\nIf you’re experiencing a connection problem, try connecting and testing your connection on another device of the same kind. To get fine-tuned results, use SpeedTest.net to get a gauge of your download and upload speeds.\nTry Power Cycling the Problem Device\nYou will be able to quickly tell if the whole network is down, but if the issue is isolated to one device, shut it down completely, unplug it from power, and remove any batteries if possible.  Wait at least 30 seconds and power the device back on. If the issue persists, move on to the next step.\nPower Cycle Your Router\nUnplug the router from power, wait at least 30 seconds, and power it back on. If that doesn’t fix the issue, move to the next step.\nIf you have any local file sharing or network storage devices, you should still be able to use them normally even if there is no internet connection to the outside world. If these protocols work fine, it further points to an issue with cabling, modem, or main line connection.\nPower Cycle Your Modem\nFollow the same routine as power cycling the router. Unplug for 30 seconds and power back on.\nIf you rent your equipment from your ISP, your modem and router are likely combined into one device.\nCheck the Modem Lights\nYour modem will likely have at least four lights on the front that flash during the powering-on process. These lights indicate the status of four important parameters: Power, Downlink, Uplink, and Internet connection. They indicate success by lighting solid. If one of these lights doesn’t light solid and remains blinking, it may indicate to you the source of your incoming signal.\n\nKipp Burroughs\n\nPower: Indicates that the modem is connected to power and turned on.\nDownlink: This light is typically symbolized as an arrow pointing downward and indicates that the modem has established a connection to a downstream channel. This channel(s) brings data from the internet into your home/business.\nUplink: This light is typically an upward pointing arrow and indicates attempted/successful connection to an upstream channel. This carries data from your home/business out to the web.\nInternet: This light is typically stylized as a globe and indicates that the internet is available. This light will not go solid if there is a failure of any of the previous three light confirmation.\n\nDiagnose Your Cable Signal Quality\nIf the previous steps yielded no improvement, you can assess its cable connection quality via the modem’s graphic user interface (GUI). This interface is accessed using a normal web browser. It is here where you can find information about signal quality and power levels.\nIf you have a device with an ethernet port, use that to connect directly into one of the available ports on your modem. If you don’t have an ethernet-capable device, try using your WiFi connection. The following instructions are for a standalone modem. If you are using a router/modem combo rented from your ISP, you may be redirected to a web page prompting you to input your account login info.\nDepending on your network configuration, accessing the modem GUI via WiFi may not be possible. Contact your ISP for more information.\nNow open any web browser. Type your modem’s IP address into the address bar. This address varies between manufacturers, but the most common addresses are\n192.168.100.1\n\nand\n192.168.0.1\n\n. Once you’ve entered the correct IP, you will be greeted with a web page displaying the logo of your modem’s manufacturer. Use the page to navigate to the status page. Once there, you can analyze your power levels.\n\nKipp Burroughs\nIdeal power levels can vary based on your router’s DOCSIS specifications. However, the modem used for this example is the Arris Surfboard 8200. It is one of the most popular modems in the world, and its firmware is used in the majority of ISP-leased modem/router combos. So, chances are that these target values apply to you\n\nDownstream power levels should be between -7 to +7 dBmV.\nUpstream power levels should be between 38-48 dBmV.\n\nInterpreting Your Level Readings\nAny power levels outside of the above ranges should be noted, particularly excessive upstream power values. Contrary to what instinct might tell you, high upstream power values indicate low power levels.  Once your upstream power value increases past 48 dBmV, it means that your modem is having to work harder to output adequate upstream power. Once this value reaches 53 dBmV, the modem will automatically power cycle and retry the connection. This often results in a boot loop that leaves the modem unable to connect for hours or even days.\nThis is the most common cause of repeated modem connection failure due to power issues.\nTo learn more, check out how to read modem diagnostics.\nWhat Now?\nWhether or not your power level investigation yielded any significant findings, you will still want to assess your environment to look for any last-ditch fixes. First, check for outages. Visit your ISP’s Twitter and check for any posts concerning service interruptions or system maintenance.\nIf that turns up nothing, sites like Downdetector can provide more info. These sites are online communities where service users can report disruptions. If your issues pertain to a larger local outage, you may just need to wait it out. If there is not a larger outage, continue by checking your modem and cabling environment.\nRule Out Overheating Issues\nYour modem should be stationed in a cool, dry place with access to open air. Like any electronic device, your modem can be prone to overheating if placed on carpet or in small, enclosed spaces. Ensure that your modem is not placed directly in the sun.\nEnvironmental Signal Interference\nYour modem and the cable that provides your broadband should be positioned a safe distance from any possible sources of radio interference. This includes microwaves, air conditioners, refrigerators, and other large appliances. Take note if your connection seems to be affected when using a certain appliance.\nInspect Your Cable Run\n\nKipp Burroughs\nLastly, you will want to trace and inspect the placement and physical quality of the cable line itself. This may not be possible if your cabling is hidden in your walls. However, if your cable runs along the outside of your building as mine does, trace back along its entire length as far as you safely can.\nKeep a sharp eye out for things that may indicate a damaged cable. Physical deformities like cracked insulation, chew marks from animals, or sharp bends may be the source of your internet problems. In this case, you would likely need a new cable run.\nConnection points should be dry and free of corrosion. Along with physical deformities, keep an eye out for any unnecessary splitters along your cable run. Splitters are small metal devices used to create two cable outputs from one input. They are commonly used to provide cable TV to multiple televisions in the home. Their usefulness is fading as the world moves toward more internet-based entertainment access.\nWhile splitters are fine for multiplying incoming television signal, they can produce unstable broadband signal. Remove any splitters from your cable run if possible. To do this, simply unscrew the connectors just like you would on a modem or cable television. You will be left with two male coaxial connectors. To bridge them together, be prepared with a coaxial coupler.\nPrepare Your List of Findings and Demand a Line Inspection\nWith this checklist at the ready, you are equipped with some knowledge and terminology to force your ISP to take further action in rectifying your connectivity issues and compensating you for prior downtime. This can be a lengthy and trying effort. Be persistent, and good luck!\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

But in those situations, how do you tell who’s to blame?\nIf It’s Not You, It’s Them\nAs remote work and smart home setups become more prevalent, our tolerance for connection failure is shrinking fast. Connection loss is a common intermittent occurrence, but what do you do when the problem becomes incessant and unmanageable? If your issues become persistent, it is possible that the root of the problem has nothing to do with your equipment or settings, but rather is due to a problem on the side of your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and may require a special line technician to intervene.\nThat may be easier said than done.\nHome technician appointments almost never occur on the day you call in a complaint. In fact, chances are that appointments are booked as far as a month out, and getting a line technician to make an appearance is particularly tricky. Line technicians are different than the home technicians that typically answer house calls. Line techs address problems stemming from the main connection to the cable line outside your home.\n\nIn cities, these main connections, or “drops” usually terminate near high voltage power lines and transformers, not to mention the seemingly endless intersecting tangles of cables, lines, and wires. The height, danger, and complexity of line servicing mean that line techs require special licensure and are very costly. Your ISP won’t be too keen on sending out the big guns for any old internet problem.\nRelated: How to Make Your Phone Useful When There’s No Internet\nRuling Out User-Side Problems\nBefore you start down the path of pursuing a line repair, it is important you take a calculated approach to ensure that the problem is, in fact, a problem that needs addressing by your provider and not something on your end. ISP customer support agents and home technicians will try and say most anything to avoid taking on the blame if you aren’t prepared with an exhaustive list of user-side troubleshooting steps you have already checked. We will start from square one.\nYou may have tried several, or all these already, but the checklist below will make sure you’ve examined your issues from all angles before tackling the task of getting a line tech to come out. Document your findings as you progress through this list.\nCheck Connectivity on Another Device\nIf you’re experiencing a connection problem, try connecting and testing your connection on another device of the same kind. To get fine-tuned results, use SpeedTest.net to get a gauge of your download and upload speeds.\nTry Power Cycling the Problem Device\nYou will be able to quickly tell if the whole network is down, but if the issue is isolated to one device, shut it down completely, unplug it from power, and remove any batteries if possible.  Wait at least 30 seconds and power the device back on. If the issue persists, move on to the next step.\nPower Cycle Your Router\nUnplug the router from power, wait at least 30 seconds, and power it back on. If that doesn’t fix the issue, move to the next step.\nIf you have any local file sharing or network storage devices, you should still be able to use them normally even if there is no internet connection to the outside world. If these protocols work fine, it further points to an issue with cabling, modem, or main line connection.\nPower Cycle Your Modem\nFollow the same routine as power cycling the router. Unplug for 30 seconds and power back on.\nIf you rent your equipment from your ISP, your modem and router are likely combined into one device.\nCheck the Modem Lights\nYour modem will likely have at least four lights on the front that flash during the powering-on process. These lights indicate the status of four important parameters: Power, Downlink, Uplink, and Internet connection. They indicate success by lighting solid. If one of these lights doesn’t light solid and remains blinking, it may indicate to you the source of your incoming signal.\n\nKipp Burroughs\n\nPower: Indicates that the modem is connected to power and turned on.\nDownlink: This light is typically symbolized as an arrow pointing downward and indicates that the modem has established a connection to a downstream channel. This channel(s) brings data from the internet into your home/business.\nUplink: This light is typically an upward pointing arrow and indicates attempted/successful connection to an upstream channel. This carries data from your home/business out to the web.\nInternet: This light is typically stylized as a globe and indicates that the internet is available. This light will not go solid if there is a failure of any of the previous three light confirmation.\n\nDiagnose Your Cable Signal Quality\nIf the previous steps yielded no improvement, you can assess its cable connection quality via the modem’s graphic user interface (GUI). This interface is accessed using a normal web browser. It is here where you can find information about signal quality and power levels.\nIf you have a device with an ethernet port, use that to connect directly into one of the available ports on your modem. If you don’t have an ethernet-capable device, try using your WiFi connection. The following instructions are for a standalone modem. If you are using a router/modem combo rented from your ISP, you may be redirected to a web page prompting you to input your account login info.\nDepending on your network configuration, accessing the modem GUI via WiFi may not be possible. Contact your ISP for more information.\nNow open any web browser. Type your modem’s IP address into the address bar. This address varies between manufacturers, but the most common addresses are\n192.168.100.1\n\nand\n192.168.0.1\n\n. Once you’ve entered the correct IP, you will be greeted with a web page displaying the logo of your modem’s manufacturer. Use the page to navigate to the status page. Once there, you can analyze your power levels.\n\nKipp Burroughs\nIdeal power levels can vary based on your router’s DOCSIS specifications. However, the modem used for this example is the Arris Surfboard 8200. It is one of the most popular modems in the world, and its firmware is used in the majority of ISP-leased modem/router combos. So, chances are that these target values apply to you\n\nDownstream power levels should be between -7 to +7 dBmV.\nUpstream power levels should be between 38-48 dBmV.\n\nInterpreting Your Level Readings\nAny power levels outside of the above ranges should be noted, particularly excessive upstream power values. Contrary to what instinct might tell you, high upstream power values indicate low power levels.  Once your upstream power value increases past 48 dBmV, it means that your modem is having to work harder to output adequate upstream power. Once this value reaches 53 dBmV, the modem will automatically power cycle and retry the connection. This often results in a boot loop that leaves the modem unable to connect for hours or even days.\nThis is the most common cause of repeated modem connection failure due to power issues.\nTo learn more, check out how to read modem diagnostics.\nWhat Now?\nWhether or not your power level investigation yielded any significant findings, you will still want to assess your environment to look for any last-ditch fixes. First, check for outages. Visit your ISP’s Twitter and check for any posts concerning service interruptions or system maintenance.\nIf that turns up nothing, sites like Downdetector can provide more info. These sites are online communities where service users can report disruptions. If your issues pertain to a larger local outage, you may just need to wait it out. If there is not a larger outage, continue by checking your modem and cabling environment.\nRule Out Overheating Issues\nYour modem should be stationed in a cool, dry place with access to open air. Like any electronic device, your modem can be prone to overheating if placed on carpet or in small, enclosed spaces. Ensure that your modem is not placed directly in the sun.\nEnvironmental Signal Interference\nYour modem and the cable that provides your broadband should be positioned a safe distance from any possible sources of radio interference. This includes microwaves, air conditioners, refrigerators, and other large appliances. Take note if your connection seems to be affected when using a certain appliance.\nInspect Your Cable Run\n\nKipp Burroughs\nLastly, you will want to trace and inspect the placement and physical quality of the cable line itself. This may not be possible if your cabling is hidden in your walls. However, if your cable runs along the outside of your building as mine does, trace back along its entire length as far as you safely can.\nKeep a sharp eye out for things that may indicate a damaged cable. Physical deformities like cracked insulation, chew marks from animals, or sharp bends may be the source of your internet problems. In this case, you would likely need a new cable run.\nConnection points should be dry and free of corrosion. Along with physical deformities, keep an eye out for any unnecessary splitters along your cable run. Splitters are small metal devices used to create two cable outputs from one input. They are commonly used to provide cable TV to multiple televisions in the home. Their usefulness is fading as the world moves toward more internet-based entertainment access.\nWhile splitters are fine for multiplying incoming television signal, they can produce unstable broadband signal. Remove any splitters from your cable run if possible. To do this, simply unscrew the connectors just like you would on a modem or cable television. You will be left with two male coaxial connectors. To bridge them together, be prepared with a coaxial coupler.\nPrepare Your List of Findings and Demand a Line Inspection\nWith this checklist at the ready, you are equipped with some knowledge and terminology to force your ISP to take further action in rectifying your connectivity issues and compensating you for prior downtime. This can be a lengthy and trying effort. Be persistent, and good luck!\nReaders like you help support How-To Geek.

IP addresses serve two main functions: network interface identification, and location addressing.\nInternet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. However, because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998. IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s.\nIP addresses are written and displayed in human-readable notations, such as 192.0.2.1 in IPv4, and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 in IPv6. The size of the routing prefix of the address is designated in CIDR notation by suffixing the address with the number of significant bits, e.g., 192.0.2.1/24, which is equivalent to the historically used subnet mask 255.255.255.0.\nThe IP address space is managed globally by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and by five regional Internet registries (RIRs) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to local Internet registries, such as Internet service providers (ISPs), and other end users. IPv4 addresses were distributed by IANA to the RIRs in blocks of approximately 16.8 million addresses each, but have been exhausted at the IANA level since 2011. Only one of the RIRs still has a supply for local assignments in Africa. Some IPv4 addresses are reserved for private networks and are not globally unique.\nNetwork administrators assign an IP address to each device connected to a network. Such assignments may be on a static (fixed or permanent) or dynamic basis, depending on network practices and software features. Some jurisidications consider IP addresses to be personal data.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Internet-Protocol-Suite":{"title":"Internet Protocol Suite","links":["Information-Technology/Internet-Protocol","Information-Technology/Transmission-Control-Protocol","Information-Technology/User-Datagram-Protocol","Information-Technology/Hypertext-Transfer-Protocol","Information-Technology/File-Transfer-Protocol","Information-Technology/Simple-Mail-Transfer-Protocol","Information-Technology/Internet-Protocol-Suite","Information-Technology/Open-Systems-Interconnection-Model"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nNot to be confused with Internet Protocol\n\n\nInternet Protocol Suite, often referred to as TCP/IP due to its most important protocols, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), is a comprehensive set of communications protocols that are used together to enable networked communications between computers.

For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.\nIP was the connectionless datagram service in the original Transmission Control Program introduced by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1974, which was complemented by a connection-oriented service that became the basis for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The Internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as TCP/IP.\nThe first major version of IP, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), which has been in increasing deployment on the public Internet since around 2006.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Internet":{"title":"Internet","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nThe Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.\nThe origins of the Internet date back to research to enable time-sharing of computer resources and the development of packet switching in the 1960s. The set of rules (communication protocols) to enable internetworking on the Internet arose from research and development commissioned in the 1970s by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense in collaboration with universities and researchers across the United States and in the United Kingdom and France. The ARPANET initially served as a backbone for the interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the United States to enable resource sharing. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, encouraged worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies and the merger of many networks using DARPA’s Internet protocol suite. The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s, as well as the advent of the World Wide Web, marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, the subsequent commercialization in the 1990s and beyond incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.\nMost traditional communication media, including telephone, radio, television, paper mail, and newspapers, are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephone, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing have adapted to website technology or have been reshaped into blogging, web feeds, and online news aggregators. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interaction through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking services. Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their “brick and mortar” presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online. Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries.\nThe Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. The overarching definitions of the two principal name spaces on the Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. In November 2006, the Internet was included on USA Today’s list of the New Seven Wonders.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/JavaScript":{"title":"JavaScript","links":["Information-Technology/Hypertext-Markup-Language","Unsorted-Items/Cascading-Syle-Sheets"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nJavascript (), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and Cascading Syle Sheets. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.\nWeb browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code.

It is responsible for managing the system’s resources and enabling software programs to interact with hardware without needing to know all the details of the hardware operation.\nKey Functions of a Kernel\n\n\nResource Management: The kernel allocates system resources—such as CPU time, memory, and disk space—among the various applications and processes running on a computer. It ensures that each process receives enough resources to function properly while maintaining the overall efficiency and stability of the system.\n\n\nProcess Management: It handles the creation, execution, and termination of processes. The kernel schedules processes, efficiently switching between them to provide multitasking capabilities, ensuring that the CPU’s time is used effectively and that processes do not interfere destructively with one another.\n\n\nMemory Management: The kernel manages the memory hierarchy of the system. It controls how memory is allocated to processes and handles memory protection, paging, and swapping to and from the physical storage. Memory management helps in isolating the processes from each other, preventing them from accessing each other’s data.\n\n\nDevice Management: The kernel acts as an intermediary between the hardware and the software running on the computer. It manages device drivers, which are specific programs designed to interact with hardware components. The kernel translates the high-level function calls (APIs) into the low-level commands for devices, and vice versa.\n\n\nSecurity and Access Control: It enforces security policies and manages user access control to files, data, and resources on the system. This includes managing user permissions and protecting against unauthorized access to the system.\n\n\nSystem Calls: The kernel provides a critical interface, known as system calls, through which programs can request higher-level services from the operating system, such as reading or writing files, sending network messages, or opening new processes.\n\n\nTypes of Kernels\n\n\nMonolithic Kernels: All the operating system services like process management, memory management, and device drivers are included in one large kernel. Example: Linux.\n\n\nMicrokernels: The kernel contains only the most fundamental components such as the scheduler and IPC (inter-process communication). Other services like device drivers, file system management, and network protocols run in separate processes. Example: Minix.\n\n\nHybrid Kernels: These are a compromise between monolithic and microkernels. They run some services like device drivers in the kernel space for performance while keeping others in user space for better security and stability. Example: Windows NT.\n\n\nExokernels: Directly expose hardware resources to applications, allowing library operating systems to provide more flexible and efficient mechanisms to applications. It essentially delegates more control to the application level.\n\n\nImportance of a Kernel\nThe kernel is crucial because it manages the operations of the computer and its peripherals. It is essential for the system’s stability, efficiency, and security. Kernels are designed to be as small and efficient as possible, providing only the necessary functionalities required for the OS to perform its operations, ensuring that the system remains robust and scalable."},"Information-Technology/Lightweight-Directory-Access-Protocol":{"title":"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Default Port: 389\n\nThe Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP ) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

The primary purpose of a markup language is to define and describe elements within a document, and these definitions are usually intended to instruct software how to display and interact with the document’s content. Here are specific characteristics that delineate a language as being a markup language:\n\n\nTag-based Syntax: Most markup languages use a system of tags to denote elements in a document. These tags generally come in pairs (a start tag and an end tag), and they surround content to apply formatting or to define the structure. For example, in HTML, &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; are used to denote a paragraph.\n\n\nSeparation of Content and Presentation: Markup languages typically focus on defining the structure and content of a document, leaving presentation details (like fonts or colors) to be defined elsewhere (e.g., CSS in the case of HTML). This separation allows the same markup document to be displayed in different styles or presented in different environments.\n\n\nHuman-readable and Machine-readable: Markup languages are designed to be easy for humans to read and write, and also easy for machines to parse and generate. The syntax is generally clear and indicative of the structure of the document.\n\n\nDescriptive, not Procedural: Markup languages are descriptive; they describe what something is rather than how it should be processed. This is in contrast to programming languages, which provide detailed commands and procedures to the computer.\n\n\nExtensibility: Many markup languages allow for the definition of new tags and attributes. This extensibility lets users and developers customize the language to suit specific needs, particularly for specialized fields of use.\n\n\nExamples:\n\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used to structure content on the web.\nXML (eXtensible Markup Language): A flexible language designed to store and transport data, with a focus on simplicity and usability over the Internet.\nMarkdown: A lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax, designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats.\n\nThese characteristics define the core essence of markup languages, setting them apart from other types of languages like programming languages, scripting languages, or style sheet languages."},"Information-Technology/Media-Access-Control-address":{"title":"Media Access Control address","links":["Information-Technology/Open-Systems-Interconnection-Model"],"tags":[],"content":"\nA MAC address (short for medium access control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.

Each address can be stored in the interface hardware, such as its read-only memory, or by a firmware mechanism. Many network interfaces, however, support changing their MAC addresses. The address typically includes a manufacturer’s organizationally unique identifier (OUI). MAC addresses are formed according to the principles of two numbering spaces based on extended unique identifiers (EUIs) managed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE): EUI-48—which replaces the obsolete term MAC-48—and EUI-64.\nNetwork nodes with multiple network interfaces, such as routers and multilayer switches, must have a unique MAC address for each network interface in the same network.

Each interaction with a key, button, knob or slider is converted into a MIDI event, which specifies musical instructions, such as a note’s pitch, timing and loudness. One common MIDI application is to play a MIDI keyboard or other controller and use it to trigger a digital sound module (which contains synthesized musical sounds) to generate sounds, which the audience hears produced by a keyboard amplifier. MIDI data can be transferred via MIDI or USB cable, or recorded to a sequencer or digital audio workstation to be edited or played back.\nMIDI also defines a file format that stores and exchanges the data. Advantages of MIDI include small file size, ease of modification and manipulation and a wide choice of electronic instruments and synthesizer or digitally sampled sounds.: 4  A MIDI recording of a performance on a keyboard could sound like a piano or other keyboard instrument; however, since MIDI records the messages and information about their notes and not the specific sounds, this recording could be changed to many other sounds, ranging from synthesized or sampled guitar or flute to full orchestra.\nBefore the development of MIDI, electronic musical instruments from different manufacturers could generally not communicate with each other. This meant that a musician could not, for example, plug a Roland keyboard into a Yamaha synthesizer module. With MIDI, any MIDI-compatible keyboard (or other controller device) can be connected to any other MIDI-compatible sequencer, sound module, drum machine, synthesizer, or computer, even if they are made by different manufacturers.\nMIDI technology was standardized in 1983 by a panel of music industry representatives, and is maintained by the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA). All official MIDI standards are jointly developed and published by the MMA in Los Angeles, and the MIDI Committee of the Association of Musical Electronics Industry (AMEI) in Tokyo. In 2016, the MMA established The MIDI Association (TMA) to support a global community of people who work, play, or create with MIDI.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Natural-Language-Processing":{"title":"Natural Language Processing","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and information retrieval. It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language.

The goal is a computer capable of “understanding” the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. To this end, natural language processing often borrows ideas from theoretical linguistics.

It’s about understanding the nuances, intent, and contextual elements of the text. NLU technologies strive to achieve a deep understanding of the text, which goes beyond the superficial interpretation of the words themselves. Here are some key components and tasks involved in NLU:\n\n\nIntent Recognition: Understanding what the user intends to do when they input text into a system. For example, determining if a user’s input in a travel booking chatbot is about booking a flight, renting a car, or finding a hotel.\n\n\nEntity Recognition: Identifying and categorizing key elements from the text into predefined categories such as names, locations, dates, and other specific data that are relevant to the interaction. For instance, extracting a date or a place name from a travel query.\n\n\nContextual Understanding: Taking into account the context in which words are used. This might involve understanding previous interactions, the specific domain of the discussion, or external factors influencing the conversation.\n\n\nSentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment expressed in the text, such as positive, negative, or neutral feelings. This is particularly useful in areas like brand monitoring and customer service.\n\n\nAmbiguity Resolution: Handling and interpreting ambiguous language, including homonyms, sarcasm, and context-dependent meanings.\n\n\nPragmatic Understanding: Going beyond literal meanings to interpret language according to its intended function, such as making a request, offering a suggestion, or giving a command.\n\n\nThe goal of NLU is to use these techniques to parse and understand human language in a way that is meaningful for specific applications, enabling more effective human-computer interactions.

Open architecture systems may use a standardized system bus such as S-100, PCI or ISA or they may incorporate a proprietary bus standard such as that used on the Apple II, with up to a dozen slots that allow multiple hardware manufacturers to produce add-ons, and for the user to freely install them. By contrast, closed architectures, if they are expandable at all, have one or two “expansion ports” using a proprietary connector design that may require a license fee from the manufacturer, or enhancements may only be installable by technicians with specialized tools or training.\nComputer platforms may include systems with both open and closed architectures. The Mac mini and Compact Macintosh are closed; the Macintosh II and Power Mac G5 are open. Most desktop PCs are open architecture.\nSimilarly, an open software architecture is one in which additional software modules can be added to the basic framework provided by the architecture. Open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to major software products are the way in which the basic functionality of such products can be modified or extended.  The Google APIs are examples. A second type of open software architecture consists of the messages that can flow between computer systems. These messages have a standard structure that can be modified or extended per agreements between the computer systems. An example is IBM’s Distributed Data Management Architecture.\nOpen architecture allows potential users to see inside all or parts of the architecture without any proprietary constraints. Typically, an open architecture publishes all or parts of its architecture that the developer or integrator wants to share.

On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.\nThe standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.\nThe PHP language has evolved without a written formal specification or standard, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard that other implementations aimed to follow.\nW3Techs reports that as of 23 March 2024 (the four months after the PHP 8.3 release), PHP is used by 76.4% of all websites whose programming language could be determined, and 57.2% thereof use PHP 7 which is outdated and known to be insecure. Additionally,  PHP 8.0 is no longer supported, meaning the vast majority of PHP users utilize outdated versions, and well over half of all websites, PHP-using or not (whose programming language could be determined) are insecure.\nWikipedia\n\nKey words"},"Information-Technology/Payment-Card-Industry-Data-Security-Standard":{"title":"Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nThe Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an information security standard used to handle credit cards from major card brands.

An equivalent system was developed secretly in 1973 at Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British signals intelligence agency, by the English mathematician Clifford Cocks. That system was declassified in 1997.\nIn a public-key cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret (private).\nAn RSA user creates and publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers are kept secret. Messages can be encrypted by anyone, via the public key, but can only be decrypted by someone who knows the private key.\nThe security of RSA relies on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the “factoring problem”. Breaking RSA encryption is known as the RSA problem. Whether it is as difficult as the factoring problem is an open question. There are no published methods to defeat the system if a large enough key is used.\nRSA is a relatively slow algorithm. Because of this, it is not commonly used to directly encrypt user data. More often, RSA is used to transmit shared keys for symmetric-key cryptography, which are then used for bulk encryption–decryption.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Random-Access-Memory":{"title":"Random Access Memory","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nRandom-access memory (RAM; ) is a form of electronic computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks and magnetic tape), where the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.\nIn today’s technology, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuit (IC) chips with MOS (metal–oxide–semiconductor) memory cells. RAM is normally associated with volatile types of memory where stored information is lost if power is removed. The two main types of volatile random-access semiconductor memory are static random-access memory (SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM).\nNon-volatile RAM has also been developed and other types of non-volatile memories allow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations. These include most types of ROM and NOR flash memory.\nUse of semiconductor RAM dated back to 1965, when IBM introduced the monolithic (single-chip) 16-bit SP95 SRAM chip for their System/360 Model 95 computer, and Toshiba used discrete DRAM memory cells for its 180-bit Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator, both based on bipolar transistors. While it offered higher speeds than magnetic-core memory, bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price of the then-dominant magnetic-core memory.\nMOS memory, based on MOS transistors, was developed in the late 1960s, and was the basis for all early commercial semiconductor memory. The first commercial DRAM IC chip, the 1K Intel 1103, was introduced in October 1970.\nSynchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) later debuted with the Samsung KM48SL2000 chip in 1992.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Reinforcement-Learning":{"title":"Reinforcement Learning","links":["Information-Technology/Machine-Learning"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is an interdisciplinary area of Machine Learning and optimal control concerned with how an intelligent agent ought to take actions in a dynamic environment in order to maximize the cumulative reward.

Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the long term reward, whose feedback might be incomplete or delayed.\nThe environment is typically stated in the form of a Markov decision process (MDP), because many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context use dynamic programming techniques.

Secure Shell mitigates this risk through the use of encryption mechanisms that are intended to hide the contents of the transmission from an observer, even if the observer has access to the entire data stream.\nSSH was first designed in 1995 by Finnish computer scientist Tatu Ylönen (to replace the Telnet network protocol). Subsequent development of the protocol suite proceeded in several developer groups, producing several variants of implementation. The protocol specification distinguishes two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The most commonly implemented software stack is OpenSSH, released in 1999 as open-source software by the OpenBSD developers. Implementations are distributed for all types of operating systems in common use, including embedded systems.\nSSH applications are based on a client–server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server.

It uses NTLM or Kerberos protocols for user authentication. It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism.\nSMB was originally developed in 1983 by Barry A. Feigenbaum at IBM to share access to files and printers across a network of systems running IBM’s OS/2. In 1987, Microsoft and 3Com implemented SMB in LAN Manager for OS/2, at which time SMB used the NetBIOS service atop the NetBIOS Frames protocol as its underlying transport. Later, Microsoft implemented SMB in Windows NT 3.1 and has been updating it ever since, adapting it to work with newer underlying transports: TCP/IP and NetBT. SMB over QUIC was introduced in Windows Server 2022.\nIn 1996, Microsoft published a version of SMB 1.0 with minor modifications under the Common Internet File System (CIFS ) moniker. CIFS was compatible with even the earliest incarnation of SMB, including LAN Manager’s. It supports symbolic links, hard links, and larger file size, but none of the features of SMB 2.0 and later.

This model allows users to access software applications on a subscription basis without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware. SaaS is one of the primary categories of cloud computing, alongside Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)  and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).\nKey Characteristics of SaaS\n\n\nHosted Remotely: The software applications are hosted on remote servers managed by the SaaS provider, rather than on the user’s premises. This centralizes the maintenance, updates, and infrastructure management tasks.\n\n\nSubscription Model: Users typically pay for SaaS applications through a subscription fee, which may be monthly or annually based. This fee often includes the software license, support, software updates, and security.\n\n\nAccessibility: SaaS applications are accessed through web browsers, making them accessible from any internet-connected device. This provides flexibility and mobility since users can access the applications from anywhere.\n\n\nMulti-Tenancy: A single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer’s data and configurations are kept separate, typically through a concept called tenant isolation.\n\n\nScalability: SaaS providers offer scalable services, with customers able to choose from various subscription levels based on their needs. Users can typically adjust their level of service as needed, scaling up or down as their business changes.\n\n\nBenefits of SaaS\n\nCost-Effective: Reduces the cost of software ownership by eliminating the need for hardware purchases, maintenance, and IT staff for software management.\nQuick Setup and Deployment: Since the software is already installed and configured in the cloud, setup times are minimal, allowing businesses to activate and use applications quickly.\nAutomatic Updates: Providers manage all updates and upgrades, eliminating the need for users to download or install patches. This ensures that all users have access to the most current features and compliance standards.\nFlexibility and Integration: Many SaaS applications offer APIs that allow for integration with other business applications, often enhancing the capabilities of both.\n\nChallenges of SaaS\n\nData Security: As data is stored on external servers, businesses must trust the provider to secure their data and protect their privacy.\nControl Limitations: Customers have less control over the software’s function and execution than they would with on-premises solutions.\nDependence on Internet: Since the software is accessed over the internet, a reliable internet connection is crucial for performance. If the provider experiences downtime, this can directly impact the availability of the service.\n\nUse Cases\n\nBusiness Applications: CRM systems like Salesforce, productivity suites like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, and HR tools like Workday.\nEmail and Communications: Services such as Gmail and Microsoft Outlook that offer hosted email solutions are classic examples of SaaS.\nCustomer Service and Support: Tools like Zendesk and Freshdesk that provide customer service and engagement platforms.\n"},"Information-Technology/Speech-Synthesis-Markup-Language":{"title":"Speech Synthesis Markup Language","links":["XML","Information-Technology/Markup-Language","Text-To-Speech","Virtual-Assistants"],"tags":[],"content":"Speech Synthesis Markup Language.

Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.\nOriginally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: Data query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML).The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control.

Although neither country has openly admitted responsibility, multiple independent news organizations recognize Stuxnet to be a cyberweapon built jointly by the United States and Israel in a collaborative effort known as Operation Olympic Games. The program, started during the Bush administration, was rapidly expanded within the first months of Barack Obama’s presidency.\nStuxnet specifically targets programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which allow the automation of electromechanical processes such as those used to control machinery and industrial processes including gas centrifuges for separating nuclear material. Exploiting four zero-day flaws, Stuxnet functions by targeting machines using the Microsoft Windows operating system and networks, then seeking out Siemens Step7 software. Stuxnet reportedly compromised Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart. Stuxnet’s design and architecture are not domain-specific and it could be tailored as a platform for attacking modern SCADA and PLC systems (e.g., in factory assembly lines or power plants), most of which are in Europe, Japan, and the United States. Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one-fifth of Iran’s nuclear centrifuges. Targeting industrial control systems, the worm infected over 200,000 computers and caused 1,000 machines to physically degrade.\nStuxnet has three modules: a worm that executes all routines related to the main payload of the attack; a link file that automatically executes the propagated copies of the worm; and a rootkit component responsible for hiding all malicious files and processes, to prevent detection of Stuxnet.

Two primary methods of replication are synchronous replication and asynchronous replication. Each hxas its own advantages and disadvantages, making them suitable for different use cases. Here’s an in-depth comparison of the two methods:\nSynchronous Replication\nDefinition: Synchronous replication ensures that data is copied to the replica (secondary site) at the same time as it is written to the primary site. The write operation is considered complete only when both the primary and replica have acknowledged the write.\nPros:\n\n\nData Consistency:\n\nProvides strong consistency, ensuring that the data on the primary and replica are identical at all times.\nThis makes it ideal for applications where data integrity is crucial, such as financial transactions, inventory systems, and critical databases.\n\n\n\nFailure Recovery:\n\nIn case of a failure of the primary site, the replica can immediately take over with minimal data loss, ensuring high availability and disaster recovery.\nThis reduces the risk of data loss and ensures business continuity.\n\n\n\nSimplified Data Management:\n\nSynchronous replication simplifies data management by ensuring that all data changes are immediately reflected on the replica, eliminating complex conflict resolution mechanisms.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nPerformance Overhead:\n\nThe need to wait for acknowledgment from the replica can introduce latency and reduce overall system performance.\nThis is especially problematic in high-latency network environments or when dealing with large volumes of data.\n\n\n\nResource Intensive:\n\nRequires more bandwidth and processing power to maintain real-time synchronization, which can be costly and resource-intensive.\nHigh demand on network and storage resources can limit scalability.\n\n\n\nGeographical Limitations:\n\nEffective synchronous replication often requires the primary and replica sites to be geographically close to minimize latency, limiting its use in widely distributed systems.\n\n\n\nAsynchronous Replication\nDefinition: Asynchronous replication allows data to be written to the primary site and immediately returns an acknowledgment to the client. The data is then copied to the replica at a later time, meaning there is a lag between the primary and replica states.\nPros:\n\n\nImproved Performance:\n\nWrite operations on the primary site are not delayed by the need to wait for acknowledgment from the replica, resulting in lower latency and higher performance.\nSuitable for applications that require high-speed transactions and can tolerate some level of data lag.\n\n\n\nBetter Resource Utilization:\n\nReduces the bandwidth and processing power requirements compared to synchronous replication, making it more cost-effective.\nAllows for better scalability and flexibility in resource allocation.\n\n\n\nGeographical Flexibility:\n\nThe primary and replica sites can be geographically distant, enabling replication across regions and even continents.\nUseful for disaster recovery solutions where the replica needs to be in a different geographical location.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nData Inconsistency:\n\nThere is a time lag (also known as replication lag) between the data on the primary site and the replica, which can lead to data inconsistency.\nIn the event of a primary site failure, there is a risk of data loss corresponding to the unreplicated changes.\n\n\n\nComplex Recovery Procedures:\n\nIn the event of a failure, recovering the most recent data can be more complex and might require manual intervention to reconcile differences.\nThe potential for data conflicts increases, necessitating more sophisticated conflict resolution mechanisms.\n\n\n\nIncreased Management Complexity:\n\nManaging asynchronous replication setups requires careful planning to handle data lags and ensure eventual consistency.\nMonitoring and maintaining the replication process can be more challenging, especially in environments with high write volumes.\n\n\n\nUse Cases\nSynchronous Replication:\n\nIdeal for applications where data integrity and zero data loss are paramount.\nCommonly used in financial institutions, healthcare systems, and any environment where the cost of data loss is extremely high.\n\nAsynchronous Replication:\n\nSuitable for applications where performance is critical, and some data loss is acceptable.\nOften used in content delivery networks (CDNs), data warehousing, and backup systems where eventual consistency is sufficient.\n\nConclusion\nBoth synchronous and asynchronous replication have their own distinct advantages and disadvantages. The choice between the two largely depends on the specific requirements of the application, including factors such as performance, data consistency, resource availability, and geographical distribution.\n\nSynchronous replication is best for scenarios demanding high data integrity and immediate failover capabilities but comes with performance and resource overhead.\nAsynchronous replication offers better performance and flexibility, suitable for distributed and high-performance applications, but at the cost of potential data lag and complexity in ensuring consistency.\n\nOrganizations must carefully evaluate their needs and constraints to select the appropriate replication strategy.\n4o"},"Information-Technology/Time-to-live":{"title":"Time to live","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nTime to live (TTL) or hop limit is a mechanism which limits the lifespan or lifetime of data in a computer or network.

TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, and file transfer rely on TCP, which is part of the Transport layer of the TCP/IP suite. SSL/TLS often runs on top of TCP.\nTCP is connection-oriented, and a connection between client and server is established before data can be sent. The server must be listening (passive open) for connection requests from clients before a connection is established. Three-way handshake (active open), retransmission, and error detection adds to reliability but lengthens latency. Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead, which provides a connectionless datagram service that prioritizes time over reliability. TCP employs network congestion avoidance.

Within an IP network, UDP does not require prior communication to set up communication channels or data paths.\nUDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues and thus exposes the user’s program to any unreliability of the underlying network; there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level, an application may instead use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose.\nUDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an option in a real-time system.\nThe protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/Web3":{"title":"Web3","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nWeb3 (also known as Web 3.0) is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics.

It was intended as an advanced storage subsystem for the Microsoft Windows operating system, designed for persistence and management of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.\nWinFS includes a relational database for storage of information, and allows any type of information to be stored in it, provided there is a well defined schema for the type. Individual data items could then be related together by relationships, which are either inferred by the system based on certain attributes or explicitly stated by the user. As the data has a well defined schema, any application can reuse the data; and using the relationships, related data can be effectively organized as well as retrieved. Because the system knows the structure and intent of the information, it can be used to make complex queries that enable advanced searching through the data and aggregating various data items by exploiting the relationships between them.\nWhile WinFS and its shared type schema make it possible for an application to recognize the different data types, the application still has to be coded to render the different data types. Consequently, it would not allow development of a single application that can view or edit all data types; rather, what WinFS enables applications to do is understand the structure of all data and extract the information that they can use further. When WinFS was introduced at the 2003 Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft also released a video presentation, named IWish, showing mockup interfaces that showed how applications would expose interfaces that take advantage of a unified type system. The concepts shown in the video ranged from applications using the relationships of items to dynamically offer filtering options to applications grouping multiple related data types and rendering them in a unified presentation.\nWinFS was billed as one of the pillars of the “Longhorn” wave of technologies, and would ship as part of the next version of Windows.  It was subsequently decided that WinFS would ship after the release of Windows Vista, but those plans were shelved in June 2006, with some of its component technologies being integrated into ADO.NET and Microsoft SQL Server.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/YAML":{"title":"YAML","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"YAML () (see § History and name) is a human-readable data serialization language.

It uses Python-style indentation to indicate nesting and does not require quotes around most string values (it also supports JSON style […] and {…} mixed in the same file).Custom data types are allowed, but YAML natively encodes scalars (such as strings, integers, and floats), lists, and associative arrays (also known as maps, dictionaries or hashes). These data types are based on the Perl programming language, though all commonly used high-level programming languages share very similar concepts. The colon-centered syntax, used for expressing key-value pairs, is inspired by electronic mail headers as defined in RFC 822, and the document separator --- is borrowed from MIME (RFC 2046).

While most DRAM memory cell designs use a capacitor and transistor, some only use two transistors. In the designs where a capacitor is used, the capacitor can either be charged or discharged; these two states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 0 and 1.  The electric charge on the capacitors gradually leaks away; without intervention the data on the capacitor would soon be lost.  To prevent this, DRAM requires an external memory refresh circuit which periodically rewrites the data in the capacitors, restoring them to their original charge. This refresh process is the defining characteristic of dynamic random-access memory, in contrast to static random-access memory (SRAM) which does not require data to be refreshed. Unlike flash memory, DRAM is volatile memory (vs. non-volatile memory), since it loses its data quickly when power is removed. However, DRAM does exhibit limited data remanence.\nDRAM typically takes the form of an integrated circuit chip, which can consist of dozens to billions of DRAM memory cells. DRAM chips are widely used in digital electronics where low-cost and high-capacity computer memory is required. One of the largest applications for DRAM is the main memory (colloquially called the “RAM”) in modern computers and graphics cards (where the “main memory” is called the graphics memory).  It is also used in many portable devices and video game consoles.  In contrast, SRAM, which is faster and more expensive than DRAM, is typically used where speed is of greater concern than cost and size, such as the cache memories in processors.\nThe need to refresh DRAM demands more complicated circuitry and timing than SRAM. This is offset by the structural simplicity of DRAM memory cells: only one transistor and a capacitor are required per bit, compared to four or six transistors in SRAM. This allows DRAM to reach very high densities with a simultaneous reduction in cost per bit. Refreshing the data consumes power and a variety of techniques are used to manage the overall power consumption.\nDRAM had a 47% increase in the price-per-bit in 2017, the largest jump in 30 years since the 45% jump in 1988, while in recent years the price has been going down. In 2018, a “key characteristic of the DRAM market is that there are currently only three major suppliers — Micron Technology, SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics” that are “keeping a pretty tight rein on their capacity”. There is also Kioxia (previously Toshiba Memory Corporation after 2017 spin-off). Other manufacturers make and sell DIMMs (but not the DRAM chips in them), such as Kingston Technology, and some manufacturers that sell stacked DRAM (used e.g. in the fastest supercomputers on the exascale), separately such as Viking Technology. Others sell such integrated into other products, such as Fujitsu into its CPUs, AMD in GPUs, and Nvidia, with HBM2 in some of their GPU chips.\nWikipedia\n"},"Information-Technology/iOS":{"title":"iOS","links":["Unsorted-Items/iPadOS","Unsorted-Items/tvOS"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\niOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its smartphones.

It’s a fundamental concept in music theory that helps musicians understand and organize the structure of music in terms of harmonic relationships. Here’s how it works:\nStructure\n\nCircle Arrangement: The circle is arranged with 12 points like the face of a clock. Each point represents a musical key.\nFifths Relationship: Starting from any point, moving clockwise, each successive point represents a key a perfect fifth higher. For example, if you start at C, the next point clockwise is G (a perfect fifth above C).\nThirds Relationship: Conversely, moving counterclockwise, each point represents a key a perfect fourth higher (which is the same as a perfect fifth lower). For example, from C counterclockwise, the next point is F.\n\nKey Signatures\n\nSharps and Flats: As you move clockwise, key signatures gain sharps; as you move counterclockwise, they gain flats. C major, at the top of the circle, has no sharps or flats. Moving clockwise, G major has one sharp, D major has two sharps, and so on. Moving counterclockwise from C, F major has one flat, B♭ major has two flats, etc.\nMinor Keys: Each major key on the circle has a relative minor key that shares its key signature. These are usually shown on the inner circle. For example, A minor is the relative minor of C major and is positioned directly inward from C on the circle.\n\nUses in Music\n\nHarmonic Progressions: The circle of fifths explains why certain chords progress naturally to others in Western music. Chord progressions often move along the circle, which sounds harmonically pleasing.\nModulation and Key Changes: The circle helps musicians plan and understand key changes, particularly modulations to closely related keys (adjacent on the circle).\nImprovisation and Composition: Knowing which keys and chords are closely related helps musicians improvise and compose music more coherently.\n\nVisualizing the Circle\n\nAt the top (0 o’clock), you have C major/A minor.\nClockwise, you add sharps: G major/E minor, D major/B minor, A major/F♯ minor, etc.\nCounterclockwise, you add flats: F major/D minor, B♭ major/G minor, E♭ major/C minor, etc.\n\nThe circle of fifths is not just a theoretical tool; it’s practically useful for all kinds of musicians, from composers and improvisers to those learning the basics of musical harmony. It helps in understanding how melodies, harmonies, and scales are interconnected, making it easier to learn new music and predict chord progressions."},"People/Fridtjof-Nansen":{"title":"Fridtjof Nansen","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview"},"People/H.-G.-Wells":{"title":"H.

However, this browser site is chock full of ads and itself can be a little heavy on system resources.  Here’s how to download and run Ookla’s lightweight CLI (Command Line Interface) speed test on Mac, PC, and Linux.\nOn Mac\nFor installing on macOS will be using Homebrew, a popular macOS package manager to install the command line speed test.  If you do not already have Homebrew installed, simply open Terminal.app and run the following command:\n/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;\nOnce Homebrew is installed, leave Terminal open.  Next, we will be running the command which will tell Homebrew to install the package for the command line speed test.\nbrew install speedtest-cli\nVoila! Once homebrew is finished, you will be able to run your speed test directly from the command line.  Do so by typing:\nspeedtest-cli\nThen, hit enter and enjoy the quick analysis of your connection speed without having to open a browser window, skipping the slowdown that can come from Ookla’s bombarding of ads!\nOn Windows\nInstalling the speedtest cli on PC is exceedingly simple.  First, navigate to the following link: www.speedtest.net/apps/cli.  Scroll down and you’ll see an option to download the app for Windows.  Note that the Speedtest command line interface app is only available for 64-bit installations of Windows.\nClick the button labeled “Download for Windows.”  Once you extract (unzip) the resulting download, you’ll be left with a file called “speedtest.exe.”  Place this file wherever you would like, keeping in mind that its specific file path will need to be referenced when running.  I suggest placing it at C:\\Program Files\\speedtest.exe as it is easy to remember and is accessible by all user accounts on your PC.  For easy deployment, consider making a desktop shortcut or pinning speedtest.exe to you Window’s taskbar\nTo run the application from the command line itself, or if you want to include it in a bigger script, simply input the full file path to the application in Command Prompt, Powershell, or Terminal and press enter.\n&quot;C:\\Program Files\\speedtest.exe&quot;\n\nOn Linux\nInstructions for installing on Linux may vary as there are so many different Linux distributions that may use default package managers specific to specific distros.  With that in mind, we are going to go over how to install the Speedtest CLI on one of the most common flavors of Linux: Debian/Ubuntu.\nFirst, open a trusty terminal window.  Now, before we run the actual command to install the speed test, we need to update the repsitory for  our package manager.  To do this we will be using a “curl” command.  If you don’t have curl installed, or if your are unsure, first run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install curl\nOnce curl is installed, then proceed to run the following command that points apt to the correct, most current repository for the Speedtest CLI Linux app:\ncurl -s packagecloud.io/install/repositories/ookla/speedtest-cli/script.deb.sh | sudo bash\nNow that apt is set to use the correct package repository, we can finally run the final command which will actually install app, after which it will be ready for use:\nsudo apt-get install speedtest\nThere you have it! From there, you can run your speedtest from within anywhere in your Linux filesystem by simply typing “speedtest” and hitting enter."},"Tutorials/Tutorials":{"title":"Tutorials","links":["Tutorials/Enhance-macOS-clear-command-with-neofetch","Tutorials/How-to-Run-a-Lightweight-Command-Line-Speed-Test-on-Windows,-Mac-and-Linux-1","Tutorials/Ubuntu-tyle-terminal-coloration-in-MacOS"],"tags":[],"content":"\nEnhance macOS clear command with neofetch\nHow to Run a Lightweight Command Line Speed Test on Windows, Mac and Linux 1\nUbuntu-tyle terminal coloration in MacOS\n"},"Tutorials/Ubuntu-tyle-terminal-coloration-in-MacOS":{"title":"Ubuntu-tyle terminal coloration in MacOS","links":[],"tags":["macOS","terminal","tutorial"],"content":"\nThis one is really simple and can be done in just a few seconds.\n1.

Swartz was involved in the development of the social news aggregation website Reddit until he departed from the company in 2007. He is often credited as a martyr and a prodigy, and his work focused on civic awareness and activism.\nAfter Reddit was sold to Condé Nast Publications in 2006, Swartz became more involved in activism, helping launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee in 2009. In 2010, he became a research fellow at Harvard University’s Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption, directed by Lawrence Lessig. He founded the online group Demand Progress, known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act.\nOn January 6, 2011, Swartz was arrested by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) police on state breaking-and-entering charges, after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet and setting it to download academic journal articles systematically from JSTOR using a guest user account issued to him by MIT. Federal prosecutors, led by Carmen Ortiz, later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release. Swartz declined a plea bargain under which he would have served six months in federal prison. Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment.

An actuator converts such an input signal into the required form of mechanical energy. It is a type of transducer. In simple terms, it is a “mover”.\nAn actuator requires a control device (controlled by control signal) and a source of energy. The control signal is relatively low energy and may be electric voltage or current, pneumatic, or hydraulic fluid pressure, or even human power. In the electric, hydraulic, and pneumatic sense, it is a form of automation or automatic control.\nThe displacement achieved is commonly linear or rotational, as exemplified by linear motors and rotary motors, respectively. Rotary motion is more natural for small machines making large displacements. By means of a leadscrew, rotary motion can be adapted to function as a linear actuator (a linear motion, but not a linear motor).\nAnother broad classification of actuators separates them into two types: incremental-drive actuators and continuous-drive actuators. Stepper motors are one type of incremental-drive actuators. Examples of continuous-drive actuators include DC torque motors, induction motors, hydraulic and pneumatic motors, and piston-cylinder drives (rams).\nWikipedia\n\nKey words"},"Unsorted-Items/Ada-Lovelace":{"title":"Ada Lovelace","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nAugusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage’s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.\nAda Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and reformer Anne Isabella Milbanke. All Lovelace’s half-siblings, Lord Byron’s other children, were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever.  He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother was anxious about her upbringing and promoted Ada’s interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father’s perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone and Michael Faraday, and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as “poetical science” and herself as an “Analyst (&amp; Metaphysician)“.\nWhen she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as “the father of computers”. She was in particular interested in Babbage’s work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him on 5 June 1833, when she and her mother attended one of Charles Babbage’s Saturday night soirées with their mutual friend, and Ada’s private tutor, Mary Somerville.\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by the military engineer Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of seven notes, simply called “Notes”.\nLovelace’s notes are important in the early history of computers, especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage’s personal notes from 1837 to 1840 contain the first programs for the engine. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of “poetical science” led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Adobe-Premiere":{"title":"Adobe Premiere","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nGlobal FX mute\nPROXIES\ncache optimized\n\nyoutu.be/PveSVJ65H1E\n\n\nPump up the ram\n\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Alan-Turing":{"title":"Alan Turing","links":["Information-Technology/Artificial-Intelligence"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nAlan Mathison Turing  (; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and Artificial Intelligence.\nBorn in London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated in maths from King’s College, Cambridge, and in 1938, earned a maths PhD from Princeton University. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain’s codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. He led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bomba method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.\nAfter the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman’s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, Turing was never fully recognised during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.\nTuring was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment, a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. Turing died on 7 June 1954, aged 41, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but the evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.\nFollowing a campaign in 2009, British prime minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology for “the appalling way [Turing] was treated”. Queen Elizabeth II granted a pardon in 2013. The term “Alan Turing law” is used informally to refer to a 2017 law in the UK that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.\nTuring has an extensive legacy with statues and many things named after him, including an annual award for computer science innovations. He appears on the current Bank of England £50 note, which was released on 23 June 2021 to coincide with his birthday. A 2019 BBC series, as voted by the audience, named him the greatest person of the 20th century.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Apache-Flink":{"title":"Apache Flink","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nApache Flink is an open-source, unified stream-processing and batch-processing framework developed by the Apache Software Foundation. The core of Apache Flink is a distributed streaming data-flow engine written in Java and Scala. Flink executes arbitrary dataflow programs in a data-parallel and pipelined (hence task parallel) manner. Flink’s pipelined runtime system enables the execution of bulk/batch and stream processing programs. Furthermore, Flink’s runtime supports the execution of iterative algorithms natively.\nFlink provides a high-throughput, low-latency streaming engine as well as support for event-time processing and state management. Flink applications are fault-tolerant in the event of machine failure and support exactly-once semantics. Programs can be written in Java, Scala, Python, and SQL and are automatically compiled and optimized into dataflow programs that are executed in a cluster or cloud environment.\nFlink does not provide its own data-storage system, but provides data-source and sink connectors to systems such as Apache Doris, Amazon Kinesis, Apache Kafka, HDFS, Apache Cassandra, and ElasticSearch.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Apache-Kafka":{"title":"Apache Kafka","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\nApache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It was originally developed by LinkedIn and later open-sourced as a part of the Apache Software Foundation. Kafka is designed to handle high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable streaming of data between systems or applications.\nKey Concepts of Apache Kafka\n\n\nTopics: Kafka organizes data into topics, which are similar to message queues. Each topic is a stream of records, where records are immutable and ordered by time.\n\n\nPartitions: Topics are divided into partitions, which are the basic unit of parallelism and scalability in Kafka. Each partition is an ordered, append-only log of records.\n\n\nProducers: Producers are applications or systems that publish data records to Kafka topics. Producers determine which topic and partition to publish records to.\n\n\nConsumers: Consumers are applications or systems that subscribe to topics and process data records. Each consumer reads data from one or more partitions in a topic.\n\n\nConsumer Groups: Consumers are organized into consumer groups, where each group consists of one or more consumers. Each partition in a topic is assigned to exactly one consumer within a consumer group.\n\n\nBrokers: Kafka runs as a distributed system across a cluster of servers called brokers. Brokers store data and handle data replication, partitioning, and serving client requests.\n\n\nZooKeeper: Kafka traditionally depends on Apache ZooKeeper for cluster coordination, configuration management, and leader election. However, recent versions of Kafka are moving towards removing this dependency.\n\n\nUse Cases of Apache Kafka\n\n\nReal-Time Data Processing: Kafka is commonly used for real-time analytics, monitoring, and event-driven architectures, where data needs to be processed and analyzed in real time.\n\n\nLog Aggregation: Kafka can be used to collect logs from various sources, such as web servers, applications, and devices, into centralized log storage for analysis and monitoring.\n\n\nMessaging Systems: Kafka can serve as a high-throughput, fault-tolerant messaging system for communication between microservices or distributed systems.\n\n\nChange Data Capture (CDC): Kafka can capture changes to data in databases and stream them to downstream systems for processing, replication, or analytics.\n\n\nStream Processing: Kafka Streams, a built-in library for stream processing, enables developers to build real-time applications that transform, enrich, and aggregate data streams.\n\n\nBenefits of Apache Kafka\n\n\nScalability: Kafka is horizontally scalable and can handle large volumes of data across distributed clusters of brokers.\n\n\nDurability: Kafka provides fault-tolerant data replication and persistence, ensuring that data is not lost even in the event of hardware failures.\n\n\nLow Latency: Kafka offers high throughput and low latency, making it suitable for real-time data processing and analytics.\n\n\nFlexibility: Kafka’s distributed and decentralized architecture makes it flexible and adaptable to various use cases and deployment scenarios.\n\n\nApache Kafka has become a foundational component in modern data architectures, enabling organizations to build scalable, real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Its versatility, scalability, and performance make it a popular choice for a wide range of use cases across industries."},"Unsorted-Items/Apache-ORC":{"title":"Apache ORC","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nApache ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) is a free and open-source column-oriented data storage format.

Aplastic anemia is associated with cancer and various cancer syndromes. Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow by stem cells that reside there. Aplastic anemia causes a deficiency of all blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nIt occurs most frequently in people in their teens and twenties but is also common among the elderly. It can be caused by heredity, immune disease, or exposure to chemicals, drugs, or radiation. However, in about half of cases, the cause is unknown.\nAplastic anemia can be definitively diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy. Normal bone marrow has 30–70% blood stem cells, but in aplastic anemia, these cells are mostly gone and are replaced by fat.\nFirst-line treatment for aplastic anemia consists of immunosuppressive drugs—typically either anti-lymphocyte globulin or anti-thymocyte globulin—combined with corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and ciclosporin. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is also used, especially for patients under 30 years of age with a related, matched marrow donor.\nAplastic anemia is known to have caused the deaths of Marie Curie, Eleanor Roosevelt, Luana Reyes, and Molly Holzschlag.\nWikipedia\n\nKey words"},"Unsorted-Items/Apple-Lisa":{"title":"Apple Lisa","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nLisa is a desktop computer developed by Apple, released on January 19, 1983. It is generally considered the first mass-market personal computer operable through a graphical user interface (GUI). In 1983, a machine like the Lisa was still so expensive that it was primarily marketed to individual and small and medium-sized businesses as a groundbreaking new alternative to much bigger and more expensive mainframes or minicomputers such as from IBM, that either require additional, expensive consultancy from the supplier, hiring specially trained personnel, or at least, a much steeper learning curve to maintain and operate. Earlier GUI-controlled personal computers were not mass-marketed; for example, the Xerox Alto was manufactured only for Xerox and select partners through Xerox PARC from the early to mid-1970s.\nDevelopment of project “LISA” began in 1978. It underwent many changes and shipped at US9,995(equivalentto30,600 in 2023) with a five-megabyte hard drive. It was affected by its high price, insufficient software, unreliable Apple FileWare floppy disks, and the imminent release of the cheaper and faster Macintosh.: 79  Only 60,000 Lisa units were sold in two years.: 77 \nConsidered a commercial failure with technical acclaim, Lisa introduced several advanced features that reappeared on the Macintosh and eventually IBM PC compatibles. These include an operating system with memory protection and a document-oriented workflow. The hardware is more advanced overall than the following Macintosh, including hard disk drive support, capacity for up to 2 megabytes (MB) of random-access memory (RAM), expansion slots, and a larger, higher-resolution display.\nThe complexity of the Lisa operating system and its associated programs (especially its office suite), and the ad hoc protected memory implementation (due to the lack of a Motorola memory management unit), placed a high demand on the CPU and, to some extent, the storage system. As a result of cost-cutting measures designed to bring it more into the consumer market, advanced software, and factors such as the delayed availability of the 68000 processor and its impact on the design process, many said that Lisa’s user experience was sluggish overall. The workstation-tier price (though at the low end) and lack of a technical software application library made it a difficult sale for much of the technical workstation market. Further impediments to the Lisa’s acceptance were the runaway success of the IBM PC, and Apple’s decision to essentially compete with itself via the lower-priced Macintosh.\nIn 1982, after Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project by Apple’s board of directors, he appropriated the Macintosh project from Jef Raskin, who had originally conceived of a sub-$1,000 text-based appliance computer in 1979. Jobs immediately redefined Macintosh as a less expensive and more focused version of the graphical Lisa.\nWhen Macintosh launched in January 1984, it quickly surpassed Lisa’s underwhelming sales. Jobs then began assimilating increasing numbers of Lisa staff, as he had done with the Apple II division after assuming control over Raskin’s project. Newer Lisa models were eventually introduced to address its shortcomings but, even after lowering the list price considerably, the platform failed to achieve sales volumes comparable to the much less expensive Mac. The final model, the Lisa 2/10, was rebranded as the Macintosh XL to become the high-end model in the Macintosh series.: 79\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Apple,-Inc.":{"title":"Apple, Inc.","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nApple Inc.

The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company’s internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.\nIn 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs’s return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the “Think different” campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\nApple has received criticism regarding its contractors’ labor practices, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing.

Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction (1:1), but  constants, comments, assembler directives, symbolic labels of, e.g., memory locations, registers, and macros are generally also supported.\nThe first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions is found in Kathleen and Andrew Donald Booth’s 1947 work, Coding for A.R.C.. Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler. The term “assembler” is generally attributed to Wilkes, Wheeler and Gill in their 1951 book The Preparation of Programs for an Electronic Digital Computer, who, however, used the term to mean “a program that assembles another program consisting of several sections into a single program”. The conversion process is referred to as assembly, as in assembling the source code. The computational step when an assembler is processing a program is called assembly time.\nBecause assembly depends on the machine code instructions, each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture.\nSometimes there is more than one assembler for the same architecture, and sometimes an assembler is specific to an operating system or to particular operating systems. Most assembly languages do not provide specific syntax for operating system calls, and most assembly languages can be used universally with any operating system, as the language provides access to all the real capabilities of the processor, upon which all system call mechanisms ultimately rest. In contrast to assembly languages, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling, much more complicated tasks than assembling.\nIn the first decades of computing, it was commonplace for both systems programming and application programming to take place entirely in assembly language.  While still irreplaceable for some purposes, the majority of programming is now conducted in higher-level interpreted and compiled languages.  In “No Silver Bullet”, Fred Brooks summarized the effects of the switch away from assembly language programming: “Surely the most powerful stroke for software productivity, reliability, and simplicity has been the progressive use of high-level languages for programming. Most observers credit that development with at least a factor of five in productivity, and with concomitant gains in reliability, simplicity, and comprehensibility.”\nToday, it is typical to use small amounts of assembly language code within larger systems implemented in a higher-level language, for performance reasons or to interact directly with hardware in ways unsupported by the higher-level language.  For instance, just under 2% of version 4.9 of the Linux kernel source code is written in assembly; more than 97% is written in C.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Blue-green-deployment":{"title":"Blue-green deployment","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nBlue/green deployment is a technique for releasing applications  by shifting traffic between two identical environments running different versions of the application\n\nthe blue version is the currently running version of the application\nthe green is the new version\n\n\nWhen youre satisfied that the green version is working properly, you can gradually reroute traffic from the old blue env to the new green environment .\nBlue/green deployments can mitigate common risks associated with with deploying software, such as:\n\ndowntime\nrollback capability\n\n\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Bosnia-Herzegovina":{"title":"Bosnia-Herzegovina","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina (Serbo-Croatian: Bosna i Hercegovina, Босна и Херцеговина), sometimes known as Bosnia-Herzegovina and informally as Bosnia, is a country in Southeast Europe, situated on the Balkan Peninsula. It borders Serbia to the east, Montenegro to the southeast, and Croatia to the north and southwest. In the south it has a 20 kilometres (12 miles) long coast on the Adriatic Sea, with the town of Neum being its only access to the sea. Bosnia has a moderate continental climate with hot summers and cold, snowy winters. In the central and eastern regions, the geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and in the northeast it is predominantly flat. Herzegovina, the smaller, southern region, has a Mediterranean climate and is mostly mountainous. Sarajevo is the capital and the largest city.\nThe area has been inhabited since at least the Upper Paleolithic, but evidence suggests that during the Neolithic age, permanent human settlements were established, including those that belonged to the Butmir, Kakanj, and Vučedol cultures. After the arrival of the first Indo-Europeans, the area was populated by several Illyrian and Celtic civilizations. The ancestors of the South Slavic peoples that populate the area today arrived during the 6th through the 9th century. In the 12th century, the Banate of Bosnia was established; by the 14th century, this had evolved into the Kingdom of Bosnia. In the mid-15th century, it was annexed into the Ottoman Empire, under whose rule it remained until the late 19th century; the Ottomans brought Islam to the region. From the late 19th century until World War I, the country was annexed into the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.  After World War II, it was granted full republic status in the newly formed Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1992, following the breakup of Yugoslavia, the republic proclaimed independence. This was followed by the Bosnian War, which lasted until late 1995 and ended with the signing of the Dayton Agreement.\nThe country is home to three main ethnic groups: Bosniaks are the largest group, Serbs the second-largest, and Croats the third-largest. Minorities include Jews, Roma, Albanians, Montenegrins, Ukrainians and Turks. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a bicameral legislature and a three-member presidency made up of one member from each of the three major ethnic groups. However, the central government’s power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized. It comprises two autonomous entities—the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska—and a third unit, the Brčko District, which is governed by its own local government.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a developing country and ranks 74th in the Human Development Index. Its economy is dominated by industry and agriculture, followed by tourism and the service sector. Tourism has increased significantly in recent years. The country has a social-security and universal-healthcare system, and primary and secondary level education is free. It is a member of the UN, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the Partnership for Peace, and the Central European Free Trade Agreement; it is also a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean, established in July 2008. Bosnia and Herzegovina is an EU candidate country and has also been a candidate for NATO membership since April 2010.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Bus-(computing)":{"title":"Bus (computing)","links":["Information-Technology/Computer","Unsorted-Items/Central-Processing-Unit","Unsorted-Items/Computer-memory"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nIn computer architecture, a bus (historically also called data highway or databus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a Computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.\nIn most traditional computer architectures, the CPU and main memory tend to be tightly coupled, with the internal bus connecting the two being known as the system bus. In systems that include a cache, CPUs use high-performance system buses that operate at speeds greater than memory to communicate with memory. The internal bus (also known as the internal data bus, memory bus or system bus) connects internal components of a computer to the mother board. Local buses connect the CPU and memory to the expansion bus, which in turn connects the computer to peripherals. Bus systems such as the SATA ports in modern computers support multiple peripherals, allowing multiple hard drives to be connected without an expansion card.\nIn systems that have a similar architecture to multicomputers, but which communicate by buses instead of networks, the system bus is known as a front-side bus. In such systems, the expansion bus may not share any architecture with their host CPUs, instead supporting many different CPUs, as is the case with PCI. While the term “peripheral bus” is sometimes used to refer to all other buses apart from the system bus, the “expansion bus” has also been used to describe a third category of buses separate from the peripheral bus, which includes bus systems like PCI.\nEarly computer buses were parallel electrical wires with multiple hardware connections, but the term is now used for any physical arrangement that provides the same logical function as a parallel electrical busbar. Modern computer buses can use both parallel and bit serial connections, and can be wired in either a multidrop (electrical parallel) or daisy chain topology, or connected by switched hubs. Many modern CPUs also feature a second set of pins similar to those for communicating with memory—but able to operate with different speeds and protocols—to ensure that peripherals do not slow overall system performance. CPUs can also feature smart controllers to place the data directly in memory, a concept known as direct memory access. Low-performance bus systems have also been developed, such as the Universal Serial Bus (USB).\nGiven technological changes, the classical terms “system”, “expansion” and “peripheral” no longer have the same connotations. Other common categorization systems are based on the bus’s primary role, connecting devices internally or externally. However, many common modern bus systems can be used for both. SATA and the associated eSATA are one example of a system that would formerly be described as internal, while certain automotive applications use the primarily external IEEE 1394 in a fashion more similar to a system bus. Other examples, like InfiniBand and I²C were designed from the start to be used both internally and externally.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Cascading-Syle-Sheets":{"title":"Cascading Syle Sheets","links":["Information-Technology/Hypertext-Markup-Language","Information-Technology/Extensible-Markup-Language","Information-Technology/JavaScript"],"tags":[],"content":"\nCascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.\nCSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.\nSeparation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.\nThe name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular element.

It is one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seven—the maximum severity—on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. The initial emergency response and subsequent mitigation efforts involved more than 500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18 billion roubles—roughly US$68 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation. It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history.\nThe accident occurred during a test of the steam turbine’s ability to power the emergency feedwater pumps in the event of a simultaneous loss of external power and coolant pipe rupture. Following an accidental drop in reactor power to near-zero, the operators restarted the reactor in preparation for the turbine test with a prohibited control rod configuration. Upon successful completion of the test, the reactor was then shut down for maintenance. Due to a variety of factors, this action resulted in a power surge at the base of the reactor which brought about the rupture of reactor components and the loss of coolant. This process led to steam explosions and a meltdown, which destroyed the containment building. This was followed by a reactor core fire which lasted until 4 May 1986, during which airborne radioactive contaminants were spread throughout the USSR and Europe. In response to the initial accident, a 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident, from which approximately 49,000 people were evacuated, primarily from Pripyat. The exclusion zone was later increased to a radius of 30 kilometres (19 mi), from which an additional ~68,000 people were evacuated.\nFollowing the reactor explosion, which killed two engineers and severely burned two more, an emergency operation to put out the fires and stabilize the surviving reactor began, during which 237 workers were hospitalized, of whom 134 exhibited symptoms of acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Among those hospitalized, 28 died within the following three months. In the following 10 years, 14 more workers (9 of whom had been hospitalized with ARS) died of various causes mostly unrelated to radiation exposure. 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were attributed to the disaster as of 2011. A United Nations committee found that to date fewer than 100 deaths have resulted from the fallout. Model predictions of the eventual total death toll in the coming decades vary. The most widely cited study conducted by the World Health Organization in 2006 predicted 9,000 cancer-related fatalities in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.\nFollowing the disaster, Pripyat was abandoned and eventually replaced by the new purpose-built city of Slavutych. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus was built by December 1986. It reduced the spread of radioactive contamination from the wreckage and protected it from weathering. The confinement shelter also provided radiological protection for the crews of the undamaged reactors at the site, which were restarted in late 1986 and 1987. However, this containment structure was only intended to last for 30 years, and required considerable reinforcement in the early 2000s. The Shelter was heavily supplemented in 2017 by the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement, which was constructed around the old structure. This larger enclosure aims to enable the removal of both the sarcophagus and the reactor debris while containing the radioactive materials inside. Clean-up is scheduled for completion by 2065.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Compiler":{"title":"Compiler","links":["Unsorted-Items/Assembly-language","object-code","Unsorted-Items/Machine-code"],"tags":[],"content":"\nIn computing, a Compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language).

A cross-compiler  produces code for a different CPU or operating system than the one on which the cross-compiler itself runs.  A bootstrap compiler is often a temporary compiler, used for compiling a more permanent or better optimised compiler for a language.\nRelated software include decompilers, programs that translate from low-level languages to higher level ones; programs that translate between high-level languages, usually called source-to-source compilers or transpilers; language rewriters, usually programs that translate the form of expressions without a change of language; and compiler-compilers, compilers that produce compilers (or parts of them), often in a generic and reusable way so as to be able to produce many differing compilers.\nA compiler is likely to perform some or all of the following operations, often called phases: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis (syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an intermediate representation, code optimization and machine specific code generation. Compilers generally implement these phases as modular components, promoting efficient design and correctness of transformations of source input to target output. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.\nCompilers are not the only language processor used to transform source programs. An interpreter is computer software that transforms and then executes the indicated operations.: p2  The translation process influences the design of computer languages, which leads to a preference of compilation or interpretation.

Besides storing opened programs and data being actively processed, computer memory serves as mass storage cache and write buffer to improve both reading and writing performance. Operating systems borrow RAM capacity for caching so long as not needed by running software. If needed, contents of the computer memory can be transferred to storage; a common way of doing this is through a memory management technique called virtual memory.\nModern computer memory is implemented as semiconductor memory, where data is stored within memory cells built from MOS transistors and other components on an integrated circuit. There are two main kinds of semiconductor memory: volatile and non-volatile. Examples of non-volatile memory are flash memory and ROM, PROM, EPROM and EEPROM memory. Examples of volatile memory are dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) used for primary storage, and static random-access memory (SRAM) used mainly for CPU cache.\nMost semiconductor memory is organized into memory cells each storing one bit (0 or 1). Flash memory organization includes both one bit per memory cell and multi-level cell capable of storing multiple bits per cell. The memory cells are grouped into words of fixed word length, for example, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 bits.

The script is named in honor of Saint Cyril.\nWikipedia\n\nKey words"},"Unsorted-Items/Data-Warehouse":{"title":"Data Warehouse","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"What is a data warehouse?\nA data warehouse is a centralized repository that allows you to store large amounts of structured data from multiple sources. This data is used primarily for querying and analysis. Here are some key characteristics and purposes of a data warehouse:\n\nCentralized Data Repository: Aggregates data from various sources such as transactional databases, operational systems, and external sources.\nOptimized for Query and Analysis: Unlike operational databases that are optimized for transaction processing (OLTP), data warehouses are optimized for read-heavy operations and complex queries (OLAP - Online Analytical Processing).\nHistorical Data Storage: Designed to store large volumes of historical data, enabling trend analysis and long-term reporting.\nSchema Design: Often uses a star or snowflake schema to organize data in a way that makes it easy to query and analyze.\n\nWhy Amazon Redshift is a Data Warehouse\nAmazon Redshift is Amazon’s managed data warehousing solution, designed with these principles in mind:\n\nScalability: Redshift can scale out to handle petabytes of data, allowing organizations to store vast amounts of historical and current data.\nColumnar Storage: Redshift uses columnar storage for data, which reduces the amount of data read from disk and speeds up query performance, especially for large-scale analytic queries.\nOptimized for Analytics: It is designed to run complex queries involving large datasets quickly. This includes aggregations, joins, and other operations common in reporting and data analysis.\nIntegration with BI Tools: Redshift integrates well with various business intelligence (BI) and analytics tools, allowing users to create reports, dashboards, and perform data visualizations.\nCost-Effective: Redshift offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model and the ability to scale up or down based on your needs, which is cost-effective for large data storage and analysis needs.\n\nUse Case Differences:\n\nAmazon Redshift: Ideal for complex queries and analytics on large datasets. For example, running reports that summarize data across millions of rows, performing data transformations, or analyzing trends over time.\nAmazon DynamoDB: A NoSQL database designed for real-time processing of key-value pairs and document data with high throughput. Ideal for use cases requiring fast, low-latency access to data, such as mobile apps, web apps, and IoT applications.\n\nExample Use Case for Redshift:\nImagine a retail company that collects sales data from multiple stores. This data is aggregated daily into a data warehouse (like Redshift). Analysts can then run complex queries to understand sales trends, forecast demand, and make strategic decisions based on historical data analysis.\nIn contrast, for the weather forecast agency scenario described in your question, the requirements are for real-time processing and storage of high-frequency key-value data. Thus, AWS Lambda for processing and DynamoDB for storage are more suitable due to their real-time capabilities and efficiency in handling frequent data writes and reads.\nI hope this clarifies what a data warehouse is and why Amazon Redshift is classified as one.\nKey words"},"Unsorted-Items/Diego-Ferrara":{"title":"Diego Ferrara","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nPietro Diego Ferrara (born 29 June 1954 in Chieti) is an Italian politician.\nHe is a member of the Democratic Party and ran for Mayor of Chieti at the 2020 Italian local elections, supported by a centre-left coalition.

Revolutionary activity lasted about eight days, involving mass demonstrations and violent armed clashes with police and gendarmes, the last loyal forces of the Russian monarchy. On 27 February O.S. (12 March N.S.), the forces of the capital’s garrison sided with the revolutionaries. Three days later, Nicholas II abdicated, ending Romanov dynastic rule. The Russian Provisional Government under Georgy Lvov replaced the Council of Ministers of Russia.\nThe Provisional Government proved deeply unpopular and was forced to share dual power with the Petrograd Soviet. After the July Days, in which the government killed hundreds of protesters, Alexander Kerensky became the head of the government. He was unable to resolve Russia’s immediate problems, including food shortages and mass unemployment, as he attempted to keep Russia involved in the ever more unpopular world war. The failures of the Provisional Government led to the October Revolution by the communist Bolsheviks later that year. The February Revolution had weakened the country; the October Revolution broke it, resulting in the Russian Civil War and the eventual formation of the Soviet Union.\nThe revolution appeared to have broken out without any real leadership or formal planning. Russia had been suffering from a number of economic and social problems, which compounded after the start of World War I in 1914. Disaffected soldiers from the city’s garrison joined bread rioters, primarily women in bread lines, and industrial strikers on the streets. As more and more troops of the undisciplined garrison of the capital deserted, and with loyal troops away at the Eastern Front, the city fell into chaos, leading to the Tsar’s decision to abdicate under his generals’ advice. In all, over 1,300 people were killed during the protests of February 1917. The historiographical reasons for the revolution have varied. Russian historians writing during the time of the Soviet Union cited the anger of the proletariat against the bourgeois boiling over as the cause. Russian liberals cited World War I. Revisionists tracked it back to land disputes after the serf era. Modern historians cite a combination of these factors and criticize mythologization of the event.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Fire-OS":{"title":"Fire OS","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nFire OS is a mobile operating system based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).

This position is indicated by the exponent, so floating point can be considered a form of scientific notation.\nA floating-point system can be used to represent, with a fixed number of digits, numbers of very different orders of magnitude — such as the number of meters between galaxies or between protons in an atom.  For this reason, floating-point arithmetic is often used to allow very small and very large real numbers that require fast processing times.  The result of this dynamic range is that the numbers that can be represented are not uniformly spaced; the difference between two consecutive representable numbers varies with their exponent.\nOver the years, a variety of floating-point representations have been used in computers.  In 1985, the IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic was established, and since the 1990s, the most commonly encountered representations are those defined by the IEEE.\nThe speed of floating-point operations, commonly measured in terms of FLOPS, is an important characteristic of a computer system, especially for applications that involve intensive mathematical calculations.\nA floating-point unit (FPU, colloquially a math coprocessor) is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating-point numbers.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Floppy-Disk":{"title":"Floppy Disk","links":["Unsorted-Items/IBM"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA Floppy Disk or floppy diskette (casually referred to as a floppy or a diskette) is a type of disk storage composed of a thin and flexible disk of a magnetic storage medium in a square or nearly square plastic enclosure lined with a fabric that removes dust particles from the spinning disk. Floppy disks store digital data which can be read and written when the disk is inserted into a floppy disk drive (FDD) connected to or inside a computer or other device.\nThe first floppy disks, invented and made by IBM in 1971, had a disk diameter of 8 inches (203.2 mm). Subsequently, the 5¼-inch (133.35 mm) and then the 3½-inch (88.9 mm) became a ubiquitous form of data storage and transfer into the first years of the 21st century. 3½-inch floppy disks can still be used with an external USB floppy disk drive.

The killing of the Archduke and his wife set off the July Crisis, a chain of events that within one month led to the outbreak of World War I.\nPrincip was born in western Bosnia to a poor Serb family. At the age of 13, he was sent to Sarajevo, the capital of Austrian-occupied Bosnia, to study at the Merchants’ School, before transferring to the gymnasium, where he became politically aware. In 1911, he joined Young Bosnia, a secret local society aiming to free Bosnia from Austrian rule and achieve the unification of the South Slavs. After attending anti-Austrian demonstrations in Sarajevo, he was expelled from school and walked to Belgrade, Serbia to continue his education. During the First Balkan War, Princip traveled to Southern Serbia to volunteer with the Serbian army’s irregular forces fighting against the Ottoman Empire but was rejected for being too small and weak.\nIn 1913, following the unexpected success of the Serbians in the war against the Ottomans, the Austrian military governor of Bosnia, Oskar Potiorek, declared a state of emergency, dissolved the parliament, imposed martial rule, and banned all Serbian public, cultural, and educational societies. Inspired by a spate of assassination attempts against Imperial officials by Slavic nationalists and anarchists, Princip convinced two other young Bosnians to join a plot to assassinate the heir to the Habsburg Empire during his announced visit to Sarajevo. The Black Hand, a Serbian secret society with ties to Serbian military intelligence, provided the conspirators with weapons and training before facilitating their re-entry into Bosnia.\nOn Sunday 28 June 1914 during the royal couple’s visit to Sarajevo, the then-teenager Princip mortally wounded both Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie by firing a pistol into their convertible car that had unexpectedly stopped 5 feet (1.5 m) from him. Princip was arrested immediately and tried alongside twenty-four others, all Bosnians and thus Austro-Hungarian subjects. At his trial, Princip stated: “I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and I do not care what form of state, but it must be free from Austria.” Princip was spared the death penalty because of his age (19) and sentenced to twenty years in prison. He was imprisoned at the Terezín fortress. The Serbian government itself did not inspire the assassination but the Austrian Foreign Office and Army used the murders as a reason for a preventive war which led directly to World War I.\nPrincip died on 28 April 1918 from tuberculosis exacerbated by poor prison conditions which had already caused one of his arms to be amputated.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Genomics":{"title":"Genomics","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nGenomics is an interdisciplinary field of molecular biology focusing on the structure, function, evolution, mapping, and editing of genomes.

Derivatives of the AT bus structure were and still are used in ATA/IDE, the PCMCIA standard, CompactFlash, the PC/104 bus, and internally within Super I/O chips.\nEven though ISA disappeared from consumer desktops many years ago, it is still used in industrial PCs, where certain specialized expansion cards that never transitioned to PCI and PCI Express are used.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Internet-of-Things":{"title":"Internet of Things","links":["Information-Technology/Internet","Information-Technology/Local-Area-Network"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) describes devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.

IoT is also used in healthcare systems.\nThere are a number of concerns about the risks in the growth of IoT technologies and products, especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently there have been industry and government moves to address these concerns, including the development of international and local standards, guidelines, and regulatory frameworks. Because of their interconnected nature, IoT devices are vulnerable to security breaches and privacy concerns.

He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922–1952) and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union (1941–1953). Stalin initially governed the country as part of a collective leadership before consolidating power to become a dictator by the 1930s. Stalin coined the term Marxism–Leninism to outline his Leninist interpretation of Marxism, also known as Stalinism.\nBorn into a poor family in Gori in what was then the Russian Empire, Stalin attended the Tbilisi Spiritual Seminary before joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He edited the party’s newspaper, Pravda, and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin’s Bolshevik faction as a gangster via robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles to Siberia. After the Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution and created a one-party state under the new Communist Party in 1917, Stalin joined its governing Politburo. Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union’s establishment in 1922, Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin’s death in 1924. Under Stalin, socialism in one country became a central tenet of the party’s ideology. As a result of his Five-Year Plans, the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, creating a centralised command economy. Severe disruptions to food production contributed to the famine of 1930–33, including the Asharshylyk in Kazakhstan and the Holodomor in Ukraine. To eradicate those deemed “enemies of the working class”, Stalin instituted the Great Purge, in which over a million were imprisoned, largely in the Gulag system of forced labour camps, and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had absolute control over the party and government.\nStalin promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements during the 1930s, particularly in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, his regime signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941. Despite huge losses, the Soviet Red Army repelled the German invasion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. Amid the war, the Soviets annexed the Baltic states and Bessarabia and North Bukovina, subsequently establishing Soviet-aligned governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe and in parts of East Asia. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as global superpowers and entered a period of tension, the Cold War. Stalin presided over the Soviet post-war reconstruction and its development of an atomic bomb in 1949. During these years, the country experienced another major famine and an antisemitic campaign that culminated in the doctors’ plot. After Stalin’s death in 1953, he was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who subsequently denounced his rule and initiated the de-Stalinisation of Soviet society.\nWidely considered to be one of the 20th century’s most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and socialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who cemented the Soviet Union’s status as a leading world power. Conversely, his totalitarian regime has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repression, ethnic cleansing, pervasive censorship, wide-scale deportation, hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines that killed millions.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Karl-Marx":{"title":"Karl Marx","links":["Unsorted-Items/The-Communist-Manifesto","Unsorted-Items/Friedrich-Engels","Unsorted-Items/Soviet-Union"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nKarl Marx (German: [maʁks]; 5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German-born philosopher, economist, political theorist, historian, sociologist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. His best-known works are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto (with Friedrich Engels) and the three-volume Das Kapital (1867–1894); the latter employs his critical approach of historical materialism in an analysis of capitalism and is the culmination of his intellectual efforts. Marx’s ideas and theories and their subsequent development, collectively known as Marxism, have exerted enormous influence on modern intellectual, economic and political history.\nBorn in Trier in the Kingdom of Prussia, Marx studied at the universities of Bonn, Berlin, and Jena, and received a doctorate in philosophy from the latter in 1841. A Young Hegelian, he was influenced by the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and both critiqued and developed Hegel’s ideas in works such as The German Ideology (written 1846) and the Grundrisse (written 1857–1858). While in Paris in 1844, Marx wrote his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts and met Engels, a lifelong friend and collaborator. After moving to Brussels in 1845, they were active in the Communist League, and in 1848 wrote The Communist Manifesto, which expresses Marx’s ideas and lays out a programme for revolution. Marx was expelled from Belgium and Germany, and in 1849 moved to London, where he wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852) and Das Kapital. In 1864, Marx helped found the International Workingmen’s Association (First International), in which he sought to fight the influence of anarchists led by Mikhail Bakunin. In his Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875), Marx wrote on revolution, the state and the transition to communism. He died stateless in 1883 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery.\nMarx’s critiques of history, society and political economy hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In the capitalist mode of production, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing his historical materialist approach, Marx predicted that capitalism produced internal tensions like previous socioeconomic systems and that these tensions would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as the socialist mode of production. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism—owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature—would eventuate the working class’s development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised proletarian revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.\nMarx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and his work has been both lauded and criticised. Marxism has exerted major influence on socialist thought and political movements, and during the 20th century revolutionary governments identifying as Marxist took power in many countries and established socialist states including the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China. A number of theoretical variants such as Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, and Maoism have been developed. Marx’s work in economics has a strong influence on modern heterodox theories of labour and its relation to capital, and he is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Kubernetes":{"title":"Kubernetes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nKubernetes (, K8s) is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management.

He was a central figure in the 1905 Revolution, October Revolution, Russian Civil War, and the establishment of the Soviet Union. Alongside Vladimir Lenin, Trotsky was widely considered the most prominent Soviet figure and was de facto second-in-command during the early years of the Russian Soviet Republic. Ideologically a Marxist and a Leninist, his thought and writings inspired a school of Marxism known as Trotskyism.\nBorn into a wealthy Jewish family in Yanovka in what was then the Russian Empire, Trotsky was initially a narodnik, but embraced Marxism soon after moving to Nikolayev in 1896. In 1898, he was arrested for revolutionary activities and exiled to Siberia, but in 1902 escaped to London, where he met Lenin and wrote for the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party’s paper Iskra. Trotsky initially sided with Julius Martov’s Mensheviks against Lenin’s Bolsheviks during the party’s 1903 split, but was non-factional from 1904. During the 1905 Revolution, Trotsky returned to Russia and became chairman of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. He was again exiled to Siberia, but escaped in 1907 and spent time in London, Vienna, Switzerland, Paris, and New York. After the February Revolution of 1917, which overthrew the tsar, Trotsky returned to Russia and joined the Bolsheviks. As chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, he played an important role in the October Revolution that overthrew the Provisional Government.\nIn Lenin’s first government, Trotsky was appointed the People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs and led the negotiations for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, by which Russia withdrew from World War I. From 1918 to 1925, he served as the People’s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs, founding the Red Army; establishing conscription, training, and discipline; and leading it to victory in the Russian Civil War. In 1922, Trotsky and Lenin formed an alliance against the emerging Soviet bureaucracy; Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his Deputy Chairman and preside over economic management at the Council of People’s Commissars, but he declined the post.\nDuring the New Economic Policy, Trotsky led the party’s Left Opposition, which advocated a programme of rapid industrialisation, voluntary collectivisation of agriculture, and expansion of workers’ democracy. After Lenin’s death in 1924, Trotsky was outmaneuvered by Joseph Stalin and his allies and lost his positions: he was expelled from the Politburo in 1926 and from the party in 1927, internally exiled to Alma Ata in 1928, and deported in 1929. He lived in Turkey, France, and Norway before settling in Mexico in 1937.\nIn exile, Trotsky wrote extensively and polemically against Stalinism, supporting proletarian internationalism against Stalin’s theory of “socialism in one country”. Trotsky’s own theory of “permanent revolution” posited that the revolution could only survive if extended to advanced capitalist countries. In The Revolution Betrayed (1936), Trotsky argued that the Soviet Union had become a “degenerated workers’ state” due to its isolation, and called for an end to Stalin’s bureaucratic dictatorship. He founded the Fourth International in 1938 as an alternative to the Comintern. In 1936, Trotsky was sentenced to death in absentia at the first of the Moscow show trials, and in 1940, he was assassinated at his home in Mexico City by NKVD agent Ramón Mercader.\nWritten out of Soviet history books under Stalin, Trotsky was one of the few of his rivals who never received political rehabilitation from later leaders. In the Western world, he emerged as a hero of the anti-Stalinist left for his defense of a more democratic, internationalist form of socialism  against Stalinist totalitarianism and intellectual contributions to left-wing movements. Whilst some of his wartime measures have proved controversial and have been criticised along with his ideological defence of the Red Terror, modern scholarship generally ranks his leadership of the Red Army highly among historical figures and he is credited for his major involvement with the military, economic, cultural and political development of the Soviet Union.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Linus-Torvalds":{"title":"Linus Torvalds","links":["Unsorted-Items/Git","Information-Technology/Operating-Systems/Linux/Linux","Unsorted-Items/IEEE"],"tags":[],"content":"\nLinus Benedict Torvalds ( LEE-nəs TOR-vawldz, Finland Swedish: [ˈliːnʉs ˈtuːrvɑlds] ; born 28 December 1969) is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and lead developer of the kernel.

Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS, and a few operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS, are sometimes referred to as “DOS” (which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system). MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatibles during the 1980s, from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system.\nIBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs. Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, the two products diverged after twelve years, in 1993, with recognizable differences in compatibility, syntax and capabilities.\nBeginning in 1988 with DR-DOS, several competing products were released for the x86 platform, and MS-DOS went through eight versions, until development ceased in 2000. Initially, MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system, but application software and user data as well. Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats, along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures. Ultimately, it was the key product in Microsoft’s development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Machine-code":{"title":"Machine code","links":["Unsorted-Items/Central-Processing-Unit","Unsorted-Items/instruction-set-architecture"],"tags":[],"content":"\nIn computer programming, machine code is computer code consisting of machine language instructions, which are used to control a computer’s central processing unit (CPU). Although decimal computers were once common, the contemporary marketplace is dominated by binary computers; for those computers, machine code is “the binary representation of a computer program which is actually read and interpreted by the computer. A program in machine code consists of a sequence of machine instructions (possibly interspersed with data).”\nEach instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, such as a load, a store, a jump, or an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operation on one or more units of data in the CPU’s registers or memory.\nEarly CPUs had specific machine code that might break backward compatibility with each new CPU released. The notion of an instruction set architecture (ISA) defines and specifies the behavior and encoding in memory of the instruction set of the system, without specifying its exact implementation. This acts as an abstraction layer, enabling compatibility within the same family of CPUs, so that machine code written or generated according to the ISA for the family will run on all CPUs in the family, including future CPUs.\nIn general, each architecture family (e.g. x86, ARM) has its own ISA, and hence its own specific machine code language. There are exceptions, such as the VAX architecture, which included optional support of the PDP-11 instruction set and IA-64, which included optional support of the IA-32 instruction set. Another example is the PowerPC 615, a processor designed to natively process both PowerPC and x86 instructions.\nMachine code is a strictly numerical language, and is the lowest-level interface to the CPU intended for a programmer. Assembly language provides a direct mapping between the numerical machine code and a human-readable version where numerical opcodes and operands are replaced by readable strings (e.g. 0x90 as the NOP instruction on x86, with 0xB8 being the MOV instruction, 0xE8 meaning CALL or 0x0F05 standing for the SYSCALL instruction). While it is possible to write programs directly in machine code, managing individual bits and calculating numerical addresses and constants manually is tedious and error-prone. For this reason, programs are very rarely written directly in machine code in modern contexts, but may be done for low-level debugging, program patching (especially when assembler source is not available) and assembly language disassembly.\nThe majority of practical programs today are written in higher-level languages. Those programs are either translated into machine code by a compiler, or are interpreted by an interpreter, usually after being translated into an intermediate code, such as a bytecode, that is then interpreted.\nMachine code is by definition the lowest level of programming detail visible to the programmer, but internally many processors use microcode or optimize and transform machine code instructions into sequences of micro-ops. Microcode and micro-ops are not generally considered to be machine code; except on some machines, the user cannot write microcode or micro-ops, and the operation of microcode and the transformation of machine-code instructions into micro-ops happens transparently to the programmer except for performance related side effects.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Macintosh-System-Software":{"title":"Macintosh System Software","links":["Information-Technology/Macintosh"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nMac OS (originally System Software; retronym: Classic Mac OS) is the series of operating systems developed for the Macintosh family of personal computers by Apple Computer, Inc. from 1984 to 2001, starting with System 1 and ending with Mac OS 9. The Macintosh operating system is credited with having popularized the graphical user interface concept. It was included with every Macintosh that was sold during the era in which it was developed, and many updates to the system software were done in conjunction with the introduction of new Macintosh systems.\nApple released the original Macintosh on January 24, 1984. The first version of the system software, which had no official name, was partially based on the Lisa OS, which Apple previously released for the Lisa computer in 1983. As part of an agreement allowing Xerox to buy shares in Apple at a favorable price, it also used concepts from the Xerox PARC Alto computer, which former Apple CEO Steve Jobs and other Lisa team members had previewed. This operating system consisted of the Macintosh Toolbox ROM and the “System Folder”, a set of files that were loaded from disk. The name Macintosh System Software came into use in 1987 with System 5. Apple rebranded the system as Mac OS in 1996, starting officially with version 7.6, due in part to its Macintosh clone program. That program ended after the release of Mac OS 8 in 1997. The last major release of the system was Mac OS 9 in 1999.\nInitial versions of the System Software ran one application at a time. With the Macintosh 512K, a system extension called the Switcher was developed to use this additional memory to allow multiple programs to remain loaded. The software of each loaded program used the memory exclusively; only when activated by the Switcher did the program appear, even the Finder’s desktop. With the Switcher, the now familiar Clipboard feature allowed copy and paste between the loaded programs across switches including the desktop.\nWith the introduction of System 5, a cooperative multitasking extension called MultiFinder was added, which allowed content in windows of each program to remain in a layered view over the desktop, and was later integrated into System 7 as part of the operating system along with support for virtual memory. By the mid-1990s, however, contemporary operating systems such as Windows NT, OS/2, NeXTSTEP, BSD, and Linux had all brought pre-emptive multitasking, protected memory, access controls, and multi-user capabilities to desktop computers. The Macintosh’s limited memory management and susceptibility to conflicts among extensions that provide additional functionality, such as networking or support for a particular device, led to significant criticism of the operating system, and was a factor in Apple’s declining market share at the time.\nAfter two aborted attempts at creating a successor to the Macintosh System Software called Taligent and Copland, and a four-year development effort spearheaded by Steve Jobs’s return to Apple in 1997, Apple replaced Mac OS with a new operating system in 2001 named Mac OS X. It retained most of the user interface design elements of the Classic Mac OS, and there was some overlap of application frameworks for compatibility, but the two operating systems otherwise have completely different origins and architectures.\nThe final updates to Mac OS 9 released in 2001 provided interoperability with Mac OS X. The name “Classic” that now signifies the historical Mac OS as a whole is a reference to the Classic Environment, a compatibility layer that helped ease the transition to Mac OS X (now macOS).\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Macintosh-operating-system":{"title":"Macintosh operating system","links":["Unsorted-Items/Macintosh-System-Software"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nTwo major families of Mac operating systems were developed by Apple Inc.\nIn 1984, Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the “Classic” Mac OS with its release of the original Macintosh System Software. The system, rebranded “Mac OS” in 1997, was pre-installed on every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s. It was noted for its ease of use, and also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors.\nThe current Mac operating system is macOS, originally named “Mac OS X” until 2012 and then “OS X” until 2016. It was developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple’s purchase of NeXT. It brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP, a Unix system, that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced, such as problems with memory management. The current macOS is pre-installed with every Mac and receives a major update annually. It is the basis of Apple’s current system software for its other devices – iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.\nPrior to the introduction of Mac OS X, Apple experimented with several other concepts, releasing different products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications to Unix-like systems or vice versa, A/UX, MAE, and MkLinux. Apple’s effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS in the 1990s led to a few cancelled projects, code named Star Trek, Taligent, and Copland.\nAlthough the classic Mac OS and macOS (Mac OS X) have different architectures, they share a common set of GUI principles, including a menu bar across the top of the screen; the Finder shell, featuring a desktop metaphor that represents files and applications using icons and relates concepts like directories and file deletion to real-world objects like folders and a trash can; and overlapping windows for multitasking.\nBefore the arrival of the Macintosh in 1984, Apple’s history of operating systems began with its Apple II series computers in 1977, which ran Apple DOS, ProDOS, and later GS/OS; the Apple III in 1980, which ran Apple SOS; and the Apple Lisa in 1983, which ran Lisa OS and later MacWorks XL, a Macintosh emulator. Apple also developed the Newton OS for its Newton personal digital assistant from 1993 to 1997.\nIn recent years, Apple has also launched several new operating systems based on the core of macOS, including iOS in 2007 for its iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch mobile devices and in 2017 for its HomePod smart speakers; watchOS in 2015 for the Apple Watch; tvOS in 2015 for the Apple TV set-top box.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Malware":{"title":"Malware","links":[],"tags":["hacking"],"content":"\nMalware (a portmanteau for malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or which unknowingly interferes with the user’s computer security and privacy.

She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. Her husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner of her first Nobel Prize, making them the first-ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.\nShe was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw’s clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. In 1895 she married the French physicist Pierre Curie, and she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with him and with the physicist Henri Becquerel for their pioneering work developing the theory of “radioactivity”—a term she coined. In 1906 Pierre Curie died in a Paris street accident. Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium, using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes. Under her direction, the world’s first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms by the use of radioactive isotopes.

The Mensheviks were led by Julius Martov and Pavel Axelrod.\nThe initial point of disagreement was the Mensheviks’ support for a broad party membership, as opposed to the Bolsheviks’ support for a smaller party of professional revolutionaries. The Bolsheviks gained a majority on the Central Committee in 1903, though the power of the two factions fluctuated in the following years. Mensheviks came to be associated with the position that a bourgeois-democratic revolution and period of capitalism would need to occur before the conditions for a socialist revolution emerged. In 1912, the RSDLP formally split into Bolshevik and Menshevik parties. The Mensheviks further split over World War I and the Russian Provisional Government, which the party supported by entering a coalition with the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the liberal Constitutional Democrats.\nIn the 1917 election to the Constituent Assembly, the Mensheviks received about 3 percent of the vote, compared to the Bolsheviks’ 23 percent. Mensheviks denounced the October Revolution as a coup d’état, though broadly supported the Bolshevik government during the Russian Civil War (while being critical of war communism).

It was the second revolutionary change of government in Russia in 1917. It took place through an armed insurrection in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) on 7 November 1917 [O.S. 25 October]. It was the precipitating event of the Russian Civil War.\nThe October Revolution followed and capitalized on the February Revolution earlier that year, which led to the abdication of Nicholas II and the creation of a provisional government. The provisional government, led by Alexander Kerensky, had taken power after Grand Duke Michael, the younger brother of Nicholas II, declined to take power. During this time, urban workers began to organize into councils (soviets) wherein revolutionaries criticized the provisional government and its actions. The provisional government remained unpopular, especially because it was continuing to fight in World War I, and had ruled with an iron fist throughout the summer (including killing hundreds of protesters in the July Days).\nEvents came to a head in the fall as the Directorate, led by the left-wing Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries (SRs), controlled the government. The far-left Bolsheviks were deeply unhappy with the government, and began spreading calls for a military uprising. On 10 October 1917 (O.S.; 23 October, N.S.), the Petrograd Soviet, led by Trotsky, voted to back a military uprising. On 24 October (O.S.; 6 November, N.S.) the government shut down numerous newspapers and closed the city of Petrograd in an attempt to forestall the revolution; minor armed skirmishes broke out. The next day a full scale uprising erupted as a fleet of Bolshevik sailors entered the harbor and tens of thousands of soldiers rose up in support of the Bolsheviks. Bolshevik Red Guards forces under the Military-Revolutionary Committee began the occupation of government buildings on 25 October (O.S.; 7 November, N.S.), 1917. The following day, the Winter Palace (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia) was captured.\nAs the Revolution was not universally recognized, the country descended into the Russian Civil War, which would last until 1923 and ultimately lead to the creation of the Soviet Union in late 1922. The historiography of the event has varied. The victorious Soviet Union viewed it as a validation of their ideology, and the triumph of the worker over capitalism. During Soviet times, revolution day was a national holiday, marking its importance in the country’s founding story. On the other hand, the Western Allies saw it as a totalitarian coup, which used the democratic Soviet councils only until they were no longer useful. The event inspired many cultural works, and ignited communist movements across Europe and globally. Many Marxist–Leninist parties around the world celebrate October Revolution Day.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Open-source":{"title":"Open source","links":["computer"],"tags":[],"content":"\nopen source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution.

The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus but in a standardized format that is independent of any given processor’s native bus. Devices connected to the PCI bus appear to a bus master to be connected directly to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the processor’s address space. It is a parallel bus, synchronous to a single bus clock.\nAttached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard (called a planar device in the PCI specification) or an expansion card that fits into a slot. The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles, where it displaced the combination of several slow Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) slots and one fast VESA Local Bus (VLB) slot as the bus configuration. It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types. Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as Universal Serial Bus (USB) or serial, TV tuner cards and hard disk drive host adapters. PCI video cards replaced ISA and VLB cards until rising bandwidth needs outgrew the abilities of PCI. The preferred interface for video cards then became Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), a superset of PCI, before giving way to PCI Express.\nThe first version of PCI found in retail desktop computers was a 32-bit bus using a 33 MHz bus clock and 5 V signaling, although the PCI 1.0 standard provided for a 64-bit variant as well. These have one locating notch in the card. Version 2.0 of the PCI standard introduced 3.3 V slots, physically distinguished by a flipped physical connector to prevent accidental insertion of 5 V cards. Universal cards, which can operate on either voltage, have two notches. Version 2.1 of the PCI standard introduced optional 66 MHz operation. A server-oriented variant of PCI, PCI Extended (PCI-X) operated at frequencies up to 133 MHz for PCI-X 1.0 and up to 533 MHz for PCI-X 2.0. An internal connector for laptop cards, called Mini PCI, was introduced in version 2.2 of the PCI specification. The PCI bus was also adopted for an external laptop connector standard –  the CardBus. The first PCI specification was developed by Intel, but subsequent development of the standard became the responsibility of the PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG).\nPCI and PCI-X sometimes are referred to as either Parallel PCI or Conventional PCI to distinguish them technologically from their more recent successor PCI Express, which adopted a serial, lane-based architecture. PCI’s heyday in the desktop computer market was approximately 1995 to 2005. PCI and PCI-X have become obsolete for most purposes and has largely disappeared from many other modern motherboards since 2013; however they are still common on some modern desktops as of 2020 for the purposes of backward compatibility and the relative low cost to produce. Another common modern application of parallel PCI is in industrial PCs, where many specialized expansion cards, used here, never transitioned to PCI Express, just as with some ISA cards. Many kinds of devices formerly available on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in USB and PCI Express versions.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Personal-Computer":{"title":"Personal Computer","links":["Unsorted-Items/MS-DOS","Unsorted-Items/Apple,-Inc.","Information-Technology/Operating-Systems/macOS/macOS"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA Personal Computer, often referred to as a PC, is a computer designed for individual use.

Compared to the instructions given to a complex instruction set computer (CISC), a RISC computer might require more instructions (more code) in order to accomplish a task because the individual instructions are written in simpler code. The goal is to offset the need to process more instructions by increasing the speed of each instruction, in particular by implementing an instruction pipeline, which may be simpler to achieve given simpler instructions.\nThe key operational concept of the RISC computer is that each instruction performs only one function (e.g. copy a value from memory to a register). The RISC computer usually has many (16 or 32) high-speed, general-purpose registers with a load–store architecture in which the code for the register-register instructions (for performing arithmetic and tests) are separate from the instructions that grant access to the main memory of the computer. The design of the CPU allows RISC computers few simple addressing modes and predictable instruction times that simplify design of the system as a whole.\nThe conceptual developments of the RISC computer architecture began with the IBM 801 project in the late 1970s, but these were not immediately put into use. Designers in California picked up the 801 concepts in two seminal projects, Stanford MIPS and Berkeley RISC. These were commercialized in the 1980s as the MIPS and SPARC systems. IBM eventually produced RISC designs based on further work on the 801 concept, the IBM POWER architecture, PowerPC, and Power ISA. As the projects matured, many similar designs, produced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, created the central processing units that increased the commercial utility of the Unix workstation and of embedded processors in the laser printer, the router, and similar products.\nIn the minicomputer market, companies that included Celerity Computing, Pyramid Technology, and Ridge Computers began offering systems designed according to RISC or RISC-like principles in the early 1980s. Few of these designs began by using RISC microprocessors.\nThe varieties of RISC processor design include the ARC processor, DEC Alpha, the AMD Am29000, the ARM architecture, the Atmel AVR, Blackfin, Intel i860, Intel i960, LoongArch, Motorola 88000, the MIPS architecture, PA-RISC, Power ISA, RISC-V, SuperH, and SPARC.

Source code can be converted by a compiler or an assembler into machine code that can be directly executed. Alternatively, source code can be processed without conversion to machine code via an interpreter that performs the actions prescribed by the source code via the interpreter’s machine code. Other technology (i.e. bytecode) incorporates both mechanisms by converting the source code to an intermediate form that is often not human-readable but also not machine code and an interpreter executes the intermediate form.\nMost languages allow for comments. The programmer can add comments to document the source code for themself and for other programmers reading the code. Comments cannot be represented in machine code, and therefore, are ignored by compilers, interpreters and the like.\nOften, the source code of application software is not distributed or publicly available since the producer wants to protect their Intellectual property (IP).

It was a successor state to the Russian Empire that was nominally organized as a federal union of fifteen national republics, the largest and most populous of which was the Russian SFSR; in practice both its government and economy were highly centralized until its final years. As a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it was a flagship communist state.\nThe Soviet Union’s roots lay in the October Revolution of 1917, which saw the Bolsheviks overthrow the Russian Provisional Government that formed earlier that year following the February Revolution that had dissolved the Russian Empire. The new government, led by Vladimir Lenin, established the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), the world’s first constitutionally socialist state. The revolution was not accepted by all within the Russian Republic, resulting in the Russian Civil War between the Bolsheviks and the anti-communist Whites. As the war progressed in the Bolsheviks’ favor, the RSFSR began to incorporate land acquired from the war into various puppet states, which were merged into the Soviet Union in December 1922. Following Lenin’s death in 1924, Joseph Stalin came to power, inaugurating a period of rapid industrialization and forced collectivization that led to significant economic growth, but also contributed to a famine in 1930 to 1933 that killed millions. The forced labour camp system of the Gulag was also expanded in this period. During the late 1930s, Stalin conducted the Great Purge to remove actual and perceived opponents, resulting in mass death, imprisonment, and deportation. In 1939, the USSR and Nazi Germany signed a nonaggression pact despite their ideological incongruence; nonetheless, in 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the largest land invasion in history, opening the Eastern Front of World War II. The Soviets played a decisive role in defeating the Axis powers in 1945, suffering an estimated 27 million casualties, which accounted for the majority of Allied losses. In the aftermath of the war, the Soviet Union consolidated the territory occupied by the Red Army, forming various satellite states, and undertook rapid economic development which cemented its status as a superpower.\nFollowing World War II, ideological tensions with the United States eventually led to the Cold War. The American-led Western Bloc coalesced into NATO in 1949, prompting the Soviet Union to form its own military alliance, commonly known as the Warsaw Pact, in 1955. Neither side ever engaged in direct military confrontation, and instead fought on an ideological basis and through proxy wars. In 1953, following Stalin’s death, the Soviet Union undertook a campaign of de-Stalinization under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev, which saw reversals and rejections of Stalinist policies. This campaign caused tensions with Communist China. During the 1950s, the Soviet Union rapidly expanded its efforts in space exploration and took an early lead in the Space Race with the first artificial satellite, the first human spaceflight, the first space station, and the first probe to land on another planet (Venus). The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 was the closest the Cold War came to escalating into full-scale nuclear war.\nThe 1970s saw a brief détente in the Soviet Union’s relationship with the United States, but tensions emerged again following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. From 1985, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to reform the country through his policies of glasnost and perestroika. In 1989, various countries of the Warsaw Pact overthrew their Soviet-backed regimes, and nationalist and separatist movements erupted across the entire Soviet Union. In 1991, amid efforts to reform and preserve the country as a renewed federation, an attempted coup d’état against Gorbachev by hardline communists prompted the three most populous and economically developed republics—Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus—to secede from the Union. On December 26, Gorbachev officially recognized the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin, the leader of the RSFSR, oversaw its reconstitution into the Russian Federation, which became the Soviet Union’s successor state; all other republics emerged as fully independent post-Soviet states.\nDuring its existence, the Soviet Union produced many significant social and technological achievements and innovations. It had the world’s second-largest economy and largest standing military. An NPT-designated state, it wielded the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world. As an Allied nation, it was a founding member of the United Nations as well as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Before its dissolution, the USSR was one of the world’s two superpowers through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, global diplomatic and ideological influence (particularly in the Global South), military and economic strengths, and scientific accomplishments.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Steve-Jobs":{"title":"Steve Jobs","links":["Unsorted-Items/Apple-Lisa"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nSteven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, inventor, and investor best known for co-founding the technology giant Apple Inc.

He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\nJobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak’s Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.\nIn 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company’s board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he helped develop the visual effects industry by funding the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm that eventually spun off independently as Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and became a leading animation studio, producing over 27 films since.\nIn 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company’s acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the “Think different” advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad.

Additional research is being conducted in the United States, the European Union, Taiwan, Japan, and China to build faster, more powerful and technologically superior exascale supercomputers.\nSupercomputers play an important role in the field of computational science, and are used for a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields, including quantum mechanics, weather forecasting, climate research, oil and gas exploration, molecular modeling (computing the structures and properties of chemical compounds, biological macromolecules, polymers, and crystals), and physical simulations (such as simulations of the early moments of the universe, airplane and spacecraft aerodynamics, the detonation of nuclear weapons, and nuclear fusion). They have been essential in the field of cryptanalysis.\nSupercomputers were introduced in the 1960s, and for several decades the fastest was made by Seymour Cray at Control Data Corporation (CDC), Cray Research and subsequent companies bearing his name or monogram. The first such machines were highly tuned conventional designs that ran more quickly than their more general-purpose contemporaries. Through the decade, increasing amounts of parallelism were added, with one to four processors being typical. In the 1970s, vector processors operating on large arrays of data came to dominate. A notable example is the highly successful Cray-1 of 1976. Vector computers remained the dominant design into the 1990s. From then until today, massively parallel supercomputers with tens of thousands of off-the-shelf processors became the norm.\nThe US has long been the leader in the supercomputer field, first through Cray’s almost uninterrupted dominance of the field, and later through a variety of technology companies.

The text is the first and most systematic attempt by Marx and Engels to codify for wide consumption the historical materialist idea that “the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles”, in which social classes are defined by the relationship of people to the means of production. Published amid the Revolutions of 1848 in Europe, the Manifesto remains one of the world’s most influential political documents.\n\n\nMarx and Engels combine philosophical materialism with the Hegelian dialectical method in order to analyze the development of European society through its modes of production, including primitive communism, antiquity, feudalism, and capitalism, noting the emergence of a new, dominant class at each stage. The text outlines the relationship between the means of production, relations of production, forces of production, and the mode of production, and posits that changes in society’s economic “base” effect changes in its “superstructure”. Marx and Engels assert that capitalism is marked by the exploitation of the proletariat (working class of wage labourers) by the ruling bourgeoisie, which is “constantly revolutionising the instruments [and] relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society”. They argue that capital’s need for a flexible labour force dissolves the old relations, and that its global expansion in search of new markets creates “a world after its own image”.\nThe Manifesto concludes that capitalism does not offer humanity the possibility of self-realization, instead ensuring that humans are perpetually stunted and alienated. It theorizes that capitalism will bring about its own destruction by polarizing and unifying the proletariat, and predicts that a revolution will lead to the emergence of communism, a classless society in which “the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all”. Marx and Engels propose the following transitional policies: the abolition of private property in land and inheritance; introduction of a progressive income tax; confiscation of rebels’ property; nationalisation of credit, communication and transport; expansion and integration of industry and agriculture; enforcement of universal obligation of labour; and provision of universal education and abolition of child labour. The text ends with a decisive and famous call for solidarity, popularized as the slogan “Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains”.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Tim-Berners-Lee":{"title":"Tim Berners-Lee","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nSir Timothy John Berners-Lee  (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language, the URL system, and HTTP.

It specifies its architecture, in particular its physical interface, and communication protocols for data transfer and power delivery to and from hosts, such as personal computers, to and from peripheral devices, e.g. displays, keyboards, and mass storage devices, and to and from intermediate hubs, which multiply the number of a host’s ports.\nUSB was originally designed to standardize the connection of peripherals to computers, replacing various interfaces such as serial ports, parallel ports, game ports, and ADB ports. Prior versions of USB became commonplace on a wide range of devices, such as keyboards, mice, cameras, printers, scanners, flash drives, smartphones, game consoles, and power banks. It has evolved into a standard to replace virtually all common ports on computers, mobile devices, peripherals, power supplies, and manifold other small electronics.\nIn the current standard, the USB-C connector replaces the many various connectors for power (up to 240 W), displays (e.g. DisplayPort, HDMI), and many other uses, as well as all previous USB connectors.\nAs of 2024, USB consists of four generations of specifications: USB 1.x, USB 2.0, USB 3.x, and USB4. USB4 enhances the data transfer and power delivery functionality with\na connection-oriented, tunneling architecture designed to combine multiple protocols onto a single physical interface so that the total speed and performance of the USB4 Fabric can be dynamically shared.\nUSB4 particularly supports the tunneling of the Thunderbolt 3 protocols, namely PCI Express (PCIe, load/store interface) and DisplayPort (display interface). USB4 also adds host-to-host interfaces.\nEach specification sub-version supports different signaling rates from 1.5 and 12 Mbit/s total in USB 1.0 to 80 Gbit/s (in each direction) in USB4. USB also provides power to peripheral devices; the latest versions of the standard extend the power delivery limits for battery charging and devices requiring up to 240 watts (USB Power Delivery (USB-PD)). Over the years USB(-PD) has been adopted as the standard power supply and charging format for many mobile devices, such as mobile phones, reducing the need for proprietary chargers.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Unix-like-operating-system":{"title":"Unix-like operating system","links":["Information-Technology/Operating-Systems/UNIX/UNIX"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA Unix-like (sometimes referred to as UNX or nix) operating system is one that behaves in a manner similar to a Unix system, although not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the Single UNIX Specification. A Unix-like application is one that behaves like the corresponding Unix command or shell. Although there are general philosophies for Unix design, there is no technical standard defining the term, and opinions can differ about the degree to which a particular operating system or application is Unix-like.\nSome well-known examples of Unix-like operating systems include Linux and BSD. These systems are often used on servers as well as on personal computers and other devices. Many popular applications, such as the Apache web server and the Bash shell, are also designed to be used on Unix-like systems.\nOne of the key features of Unix-like systems is their ability to support multiple users and processes simultaneously. This allows users to run multiple programs at the same time and to share resources such as memory and disk space. This is in contrast to many older operating systems, which were designed to only support a single user or process at a time. Another important feature of Unix-like systems is their modularity. This means that the operating system is made up of many small, interchangeable components that can be added or removed as needed. This makes it easy to customize the operating system to suit the needs of different users or environments.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Unsorted-Items":{"title":"Unsorted

He served as the first and founding head of government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1917 until his death in 1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 until his death. Under his administration, Russia, and later the Soviet Union, became a one-party socialist state governed by the Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, his developments to the ideology are called Leninism.\nBorn to a schoolteacher’s family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother’s 1887 execution. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Tsarist government, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He relocated to Saint Petersburg in 1893 where he became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye in Siberia for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in the RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov’s Mensheviks. Following Russia’s failed Revolution of 1905, he initially campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which, as a Marxist, he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and the rise of socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia and played a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new government.\nLenin’s Bolshevik government initially shared power with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, elected soviets, and a multi-party Constituent Assembly, although by 1918 it had centralised power in the new Communist Party. Lenin’s administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. It withdrew from the First World War by signing a treaty conceding territory to the Central Powers, and promoted world revolution through the Communist International. Opponents were suppressed in the Red Terror, a violent campaign administered by the state security services; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps. His administration defeated right and left-wing anti-Bolshevik armies in the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921. Responding to wartime devastation, famine, and popular uprisings, in 1921 Lenin encouraged economic growth through the New Economic Policy. Several non-Russian nations had secured independence from Russia after 1917, but five were forcibly re-united into the new Soviet Union in 1922, while others repelled Soviet invasions. His health failing, Lenin died in Gorki, with Joseph Stalin succeeding him as the pre-eminent figure in the Soviet government.\nWidely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism–Leninism and a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive historical figure, Lenin is viewed by his supporters as a champion of socialism, communism, anti-imperialism and the working class, while his critics accuse him of establishing a totalitarian dictatorship that oversaw mass killings and political repression of dissidents.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Voice-over-Internet-Protocol":{"title":"Voice over Internet Protocol","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), also called IP telephony, is a method and group of technologies for voice calls for the delivery of voice communication sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet.\nThe broader terms Internet telephony, broadband telephony, and broadband phone service specifically refer to the provisioning of voice and other communications services (fax, SMS, voice messaging) over the Internet, rather than via the public switched telephone network (PSTN), also known as plain old telephone service (POTS).\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Warsaw-Pact":{"title":"Warsaw Pact","links":["Unsorted-Items/Soviet-Union","Unsorted-Items/Eastern-Bloc"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\nA collective defense treatey.

It was released to manufacturing on August 1, 2012, and was made available for download via MSDN and TechNet on August 15, 2012. Nearly three months after its initial release, it finally made its first retail appearance on October 26, 2012.\nWindows 8 introduced major changes to the operating system’s platform and user interface with the intention to improve its user experience on tablets, where Windows  competed with mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS. In particular, these changes included a touch-optimized Windows shell and start screen based on Microsoft’s Metro design language, integration with online services, the Windows Store, and a new keyboard shortcut for screenshots. Many of these features were adapted from Windows Phone. Windows 8 also added support for USB 3.0, Advanced Format, near-field communication, and cloud computing, as well as a new lock screen with clock and notifications and the previously released “Domino” and “Beauty and a Beat”. Additional security features—including built-in antivirus software, integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering, and support for Secure Boot on supported devices—were introduced. It was the first Windows version to support ARM architecture under the Windows RT branding. No CPUs without PAE, SSE2 and NX are supported in this version.\nWindows 8 received a mostly negative reception. Although the reaction to its performance improvements, security enhancements, and improved support for touchscreen devices was positive, the new user interface was widely criticized as confusing and unintuitive, especially when used with a keyboard and mouse rather than a touchscreen. Despite these shortcomings, 60 million licenses were sold through January 2013, including upgrades and sales to OEMs for new PCs.\nMicrosoft released Windows 8.1 in October 2013, which addressed some aspects of Windows 8 that were criticized by reviewers and early adopters and also incorporated various improvements. Windows 8 was ultimately succeeded by Windows 10 in July 2015. Support for RTM editions of Windows 8 ended on January 12, 2016, and with the exception of Windows Embedded 8 Standard users, all users are required to install the Windows 8.1 update. Mainstream support for the Embedded Standard edition of Windows 8 ended on July 10, 2018, and extended support ended on July 11, 2023.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/Windows-NT":{"title":"Windows NT","links":["Unsorted-Items/Microsoft-Hyper-V"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nWindows NT is a proprietary graphical operating system produced by Microsoft as part of its Windows product line, the first version of which was released on July 27, 1993, and it lives on today since the latest version of Windows, 11, includes its technology.\nThe Windows NT name denotes major technology advancements that it introduced to the Windows product line including eliminating the 16-bit memory access limitations of earlier Windows releases.

An updated version of Windows 2000 was also initially planned for the business market. However, in January 2000, both projects were scrapped in favor of a single OS codenamed “Whistler”, which would serve as a single platform for both consumer and business markets. As a result, Windows XP is the first consumer edition of Windows not based on the Windows 95 kernel or MS-DOS. Windows XP removed support for PC-98, i486 and SGI Visual Workstation 320 and 540 and will only run on 32-bit x86 CPUs and devices that use BIOS firmware.\nUpon its release, Windows XP received critical acclaim, noting increased performance and stability (especially compared to Windows Me), a more intuitive user interface, improved hardware support, and expanded multimedia capabilities. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were succeeded by Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, released in 2007 and 2008, respectively. However, some criticisms of Windows XP were its security issues at launch, and many people believed their anti-piracy schemes had gone too far.\nMainstream support for the main Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009, and extended support ended on April 8, 2014. Windows Embedded POSReady 2009, based on an embedded version of Windows XP Professional, was the last supported version of Windows based on the Windows XP codebase, and received security updates until April 2019. Prior to the main Windows XP’s end of support date, unofficial methods were made available to apply the updates to other editions of Windows XP. Microsoft has discouraged this practice, citing compatibility issues. Extended support for Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 ended on April 9, 2019, marking the overall end of the Windows XP codebase after 18 years.\nFive years since the end of Windows XP’s overall support date including the extended support of Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 (as of 2024), a large majority of PCs in Armenia still appear to be running Windows XP. Few have also had some significant share, such as Colombia.  As of 2024, globally,  under 0.6%  of Windows PCs  and 0.1% of all devices across all platforms continued to run Windows XP.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/X.509":{"title":"X.509","links":["Information-Technology/Transport-Layer-Security","Information-Technology/Secure-Sockets-Layer","Information-Technology/RSA-(cryptosystem)","Unsorted-Items/ECDSA","Unsorted-Items/ed25519","Unsorted-Items/Certificate-authority"],"tags":[],"content":"\nIn cryptography, X.509 is an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard defining the format of public key certificates.

When a certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority, or validated by other means, someone holding that certificate can use the public key it contains to establish secure communications with another party, or validate documents digitally signed by the corresponding private key.\nX.509 also defines certificate revocation lists, which are a means to distribute information about certificates that have been deemed invalid by a signing authority, as well as a certification path validation algorithm, which allows for certificates to be signed by intermediate CA certificates, which are, in turn, signed by other certificates, eventually reaching a trust anchor.\nX.509 is defined by the ITU’s “Standardization Sector” (ITU-T’s SG17), in ITU-T Study Group 17 and is based on Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), another ITU-T standard.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/best-vsts":{"title":"best vsts","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Unsorted-Items/calendar":{"title":"calendar","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Unsorted-Items/cryptoprocessor":{"title":"cryptoprocessor","links":["Unsorted-Items/microprocessor"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA secure cryptoprocessor is a dedicated computer-on-a-chip or microprocessor for carrying out cryptographic operations, embedded in a packaging with multiple physical security measures, which give it a degree of tamper resistance.

A device or program that executes instructions described by that ISA, such as a central processing unit (CPU), is called an implementation of that ISA.\nIn general, an ISA defines the supported instructions, data types, registers, the hardware support for managing main memory, fundamental features (such as the memory consistency, addressing modes, virtual memory), and the input/output model of implementations of the ISA.\nAn ISA specifies the behavior of machine code running on implementations of that ISA in a fashion that does not depend on the characteristics of that implementation, providing binary compatibility between implementations. This enables multiple implementations of an ISA that differ in characteristics such as performance, physical size, and monetary cost (among other things), but that are capable of running the same machine code, so that a lower-performance, lower-cost machine can be replaced with a higher-cost, higher-performance machine without having to replace software.  It also enables the evolution of the microarchitectures of the implementations of that ISA, so that a newer, higher-performance implementation of an ISA can run software that runs on previous generations of implementations.\nIf an operating system maintains a standard and compatible application binary interface (ABI) for a particular ISA, machine code will run on future implementations of that ISA and operating system.  However, if an ISA supports running multiple operating systems, it does not guarantee that machine code for one operating system will run on another operating system, unless the first operating system supports running machine code built for the other operating system.\nAn ISA can be extended by adding instructions or other capabilities, or adding support for larger addresses and data values; an implementation of the extended ISA will still be able to execute machine code for versions of the ISA without those extensions.  Machine code using those extensions will only run on implementations that support those extensions.\nThe binary compatibility that they provide makes ISAs one of the most fundamental abstractions in computing.\nWikipedia\n"},"Unsorted-Items/microprocessor":{"title":"microprocessor","links":["Unsorted-Items/Central-Processing-Unit"],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\nA microprocessor is a computer processor for which the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit (IC), or a small number of ICs. The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer’s central processing unit (CPU). The IC is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results (also in binary form) as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic, and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.\nThe integration of a whole CPU onto a single or a few integrated circuits using Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) greatly reduced the cost of processing power. Integrated circuit processors are produced in large numbers by highly automated metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) fabrication processes, resulting in a relatively low unit price. Single-chip processors increase reliability because there are fewer electrical connections that can fail. As microprocessor designs improve, the cost of manufacturing a chip (with smaller components built on a semiconductor chip the same size) generally stays the same according to Rock’s law.\nBefore microprocessors, small computers had been built using racks of circuit boards with many medium- and small-scale integrated circuits, typically of TTL type. Microprocessors combined this into one or a few large-scale ICs. While there is disagreement over who deserves credit for the invention of the microprocessor, the first commercially available microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed by Federico Faggin and introduced in 1971.\nContinued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete (see history of computing hardware), with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest embedded systems and handheld devices to the largest mainframes and supercomputers.\nA microprocessor is distinct from a microcontroller including a system on a chip. A microprocessor is related but distinct from a digital signal processor.\nWikipedia\n\nKey words"},"Unsorted-Items/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-approaches-to-input-output":{"title":"synchronous vs asynchronous approaches to input-output","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\nKey words"},"Unsorted-Items/tvOS":{"title":"tvOS","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Overview\n\ntvOS (formerly Apple TV Software) is an operating system developed by Apple Inc. for the Apple TV, a digital media player.

The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel’s 8-bit 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term “x86” came into being because the names of several successors to Intel’s 8086 processor end in “86”, including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. Colloquially, their names were “186”, “286”, “386” and “486”.\nThe term is not synonymous with IBM PC compatibility, as this implies a multitude of other computer hardware. Embedded systems and general-purpose computers used x86 chips before the PC-compatible market started, some of them before the IBM PC (1981) debut.\nAs of June 2022, most desktop and laptop computers sold are based on the x86 architecture family, while mobile categories such as smartphones or tablets are dominated by ARM. At the high end, x86 continues to dominate computation-intensive workstation and cloud computing segments. The fastest supercomputer in the TOP500 list for June 2022 was the first exascale system, Frontier, built using AMD Epyc CPUs based on the x86 ISA; it broke the 1 exaFLOPS barrier in May 2022.\nWikipedia\n"},"flashcards/flashcards":{"title":"flashcards","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"index":{"title":"Home","links":["Amazon-Web-Services/Amazon-Web-Services","SAA-C03-Exam/SAA-C03-Exam","Information-Technology/Information-Technology","Music/Music","People/People","Historical/Historical","Tutorials/Tutorials","Unsorted-Items/Unsorted-Items"],"tags":[],"content":"Kipp Burroughs’s Knowledge Vault\n\nCreated using Obsidian\nBuilt using Quartz\nHosted on GitHub Pages\n\nVault Overview\n\n\nAmazon Web Services\n\n\nSAA-C03 Exam\n\n\nInformation Technology\n\n\nMusic\n\n\nPeople\n\n\nHistorical\n\n\nTutorials\n\n\nUnsorted Items\n\n\nKipp’s Personal Links\n\nLink Tree\nLinkedIn\nYouTube\nSoundCloud\nTwitch\nDev Community\nGitHub\n"},"vault_resources/Vault-Guidelines-and-Protocols":{"title":"Vault Guidelines and Protocols","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"A place to document or flesh out methodologies and practices as it concerns Obsidian and how I use it to maximize, output, writing speed ,\nVault Guidelines and Protocols\nIndenting Subheadings\n\nto indent a subheading (like the one directly above this line), place 7 spaces after the initial space proceeding a # that will format that line as a header.
