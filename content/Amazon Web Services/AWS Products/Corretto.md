# Overview

AWS Corretto is a no-cost, multiplatform, production-ready distribution of the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK) that is maintained and supported by Amazon Web Services. AWS Corretto is designed to provide a long-term supported and performance-optimized solution for running Java applications on popular operating systems including Linux, Windows, and macOS.

### Key Features of AWS Corretto

1. **Long-Term Support**: AWS commits to long-term support for Corretto, with each major version receiving updates and security fixes for an extended period, even beyond the support period of the corresponding OpenJDK version. This ensures stability and security for Java applications in production environments.
    
2. **Performance Optimizations**: Corretto includes performance enhancements and fixes above and beyond the standard OpenJDK, ensuring optimal performance for Java applications, particularly those running on AWS infrastructure but also on any other environment.
    
3. **No-Cost Licensing**: AWS Corretto is available at no cost. It is a drop-in replacement for all Java SE distributions unless you specifically require additional commercial features not available in OpenJDK.
    
4. **Compatibility**: Corretto is designed to be fully compatible with the Java SE standard and passes all related compliance tests, making it a reliable choice for enterprise applications.
    
5. **Platform Support**: Available for use on multiple platforms, including Amazon Linux 2, Windows, macOS, and Docker, offering flexibility for deployment in diverse IT environments.
    

### How It Works

- **Installation**: Corretto can be downloaded from the AWS website and installed on any supported operating system. It includes installers and binary files ready for deployment in production environments.
    
- **Usage**: Once installed, it can be used just like any other OpenJDK version to run Java applications. Developers and system administrators can configure their application runtime environments to use Corretto as the Java virtual machine.
    
- **Updates and Upgrades**: Amazon provides quarterly updates that include both security patches and other critical fixes. These updates are available for download from the same AWS sources, ensuring easy maintenance and management.
    

### Benefits

- **Security and Stability**: With long-term support and regular updates, Corretto provides a stable and secure platform for running Java applications, mitigating risks associated with unsupported Java environments.
    
- **Cost Efficiency**: Being a free distribution of OpenJDK, it helps organizations reduce costs associated with acquiring Java SE licenses, particularly for those not requiring commercial features.
    
- **Seamless Migration**: Corretto is designed to be a drop-in replacement for any other JDK, making migration straightforward for existing Java applications.
    

### Use Cases

- **Enterprise Applications**: Many enterprises rely on Java for critical business applications. Corretto's long-term support and stability make it an ideal choice for these scenarios.
    
- **Cloud Applications**: For applications deployed on AWS or other cloud environments, Corretto provides performance optimizations that can enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs.
    
- **Development Environments**: Developers can use Corretto in their local development environments knowing that they are developing against the same Java platform that will be used in their production environments.
    

AWS Corretto provides organizations and developers with a dependable, cost-effective, and performance-optimized Java SE compliant environment, backed by AWS's commitment to the Java community and its customers.
