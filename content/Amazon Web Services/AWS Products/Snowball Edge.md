# Snowball Edge
Snowball Edge is an edge computing and data transfer device provided by the AWS Snowball service. It has on-board storage and compute power that provides select AWS services for use in edge locations. However, one Snowball Edge only provides up to 100 TB of capacity. Therefore, to transfer 50 PBs, AWS Snowball Edge is not the most cost-effective option.
