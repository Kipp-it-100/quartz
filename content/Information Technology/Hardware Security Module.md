# Overview
> A **Hardware Security Module** (HSM) is a physical computing device that safeguards and manages secrets (most importantly digital keys), performs [[encryption]] and decryption functions for digital signatures, strong authentication and other cryptographic functions. These modules traditionally come in the form of a plug-in  card (so called internal HSM) or an external device that attaches directly to a computer or network server (so called network HSM). A hardware security module contains one or more secure [[cryptoprocessor]] chips.
